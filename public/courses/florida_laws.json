The agent's primary responsibility in the\n   application process is to the insurer.\nTwisting occurs when an insurance agent convinces a policyowner to\n   cancel their current policy so that they can purchase new life insurance\n   policy with another company. This would involve the agent using\n   misrepresentations or incomplete comparisons of the advantages and\n   disadvantages of the two policies. Twisting is a form of\n   misrepresentation and is illegal.\nChurning occurs when an agent has a policyholder replace one policy for\n   another with the same company for the sole purpose of making more\n   commission. This can involve using the cash value and/or dividends of\n   an existing policy to purchase another policy with the same insurer. This\n\n\f    normally is done using misrepresentation or deception and is not in the\n    policyholder\u2019s best interest.\nSliding occurs when an agent tells an applicant that in order to get the\n    product they want, they are required by law to get an additional\n    product as well. It can also mean falsely representing to an applicant\n    that specific coverage is included in the policy applied for with no\n    additional charge.\nCoercion is when an agent uses physical or mental force, with the intent\n    of convincing an applicant to buy insurance.\nMisrepresentation is when an agent uses publications, sales materials, or\n    makes statements that are false, misleading, or deceptive to unfairly\n    influence the purchase of a policy.\nDefamation occurs when an oral or written statement is maliciously made\n    that is intended to injure a person in the insurance business or be\n    critical and misleading about the financial condition of a person or\n    company.\nFraud occurs when someone intentionally deceives another with the\n    intent to gain financially.\nIt is an illegal practice to unfairly discriminate against a person in any way\n    on an insurance-related matter. An example would be providing\n    different terms of coverage for different policyowners in the same risk\n    classification. Fair discrimination is necessary for the issuance of life\n    insurance policies, which is based on mortality.\nControlled business is coverage written by an agent on his/her own life,\n    health, property, immediate family, or business associates. Most states\n    will not issue a license to a person if it is determined that their primary\n    purpose is to write controlled business.\nRebating happens when an agent refunds part of their commission, or\n    exchanges anything of value to induce someone to purchase an\n\n\f    insurance policy. Rebating is allowed in Florida if the agent rebates\n    insureds in the same actuarial class.\nIt is an illegal practice to falsely advertise insurance products or publish\n    misleading information about its insurance coverage. This includes\n    making false statements about the financial condition of an insurer.\nThe following acts, omissions, or practices are defined as unfair and\n    deceptive claim settlement practices, when knowingly committed or\n    performed with such frequency as to indicate a general business\n    practice, and are prohibited:\n o Misrepresenting to insured\u2019s pertinent facts or policy provisions\n     relating to coverage at issue\n o Failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon\n     communications with respect to an insurance claim\n o Failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for prompt\n     investigation and processing of insured\u2019s claims\n o Failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time\n     after proof of loss statements are completed and submitted by insured\n o Not attempting in good faith to effect prompt, fair and equitable\n     settlements of claims on which liability has become reasonably clear;\n     Refusing or delaying a settlement solely because there is other\n     insurance available to partially or entirely satisfy the claim loss; the\n     claimant who has a right to recover from more than one insurer has\n     the right to choose the coverage from which to recover and the order\n     in which payment is to be made\n o Compelling insured to initiate suits to recover amounts due under an\n     insurance policy by offering substantially less than the amount\n     ultimately recovered in those suits\nInsurance companies are classified according to the location of its\n    corporation.

This document explains how a buyer\n                 should go about choosing the amount and type of\n                 insurance to buy, and how a buyer can save money by\n                 comparing the cost of similar policies.\n              \uf09f Life insurance policies must provide a grace period of 31\n                 days after the due date. If the insured dies during the\n                 grace period, the insurance company may deduct any\n                 premium due from the death benefit.\n              \uf09f The maximum fixed policy loan interest rate that an\n                 insurer can charge in Florida is 10%. Adjustable rates for\n                 policy loans are based on Moody\u2019s corporate bond\n                 index.\n              \uf09f In Florida, if a policy is made payable to a named\n                 beneficiary, a creditor can make no claim on the\n                 proceeds.\n              \uf09f In Florida, anyone over the age of 64 will receive an\n                 additional 21 days beyond the normal policy grace\n                 period.\n              \uf09f In Florida, if an insured commits suicide within 2 years of\n                 policy issue, the beneficiary will only receive a refund of\n                 premiums paid. After two years, the face amount will be\n                 paid in the event of suicide.\n\n\f             \uf09f When an insured has industrial life insurance policies with\n               a single insurance company that total $3,000 or more in\n               face value, the insured has the option to convert all of\n               these policies into one ordinary life insurance policy at\n               standard premium without evidence of insurability.\n             \uf09f An insurance company that requires an application for\n               reinstatement has 45 days to reject the application\n               before reinstatement is automatic. In other words, if the\n               insurer takes no action within 45 days, the policy is\n               considered reinstated automatically.\n             \uf09f Under Florida law, \"excess business\" is permitted when\n               an agent's own company is not able to write the amount\n               of insurance requested by the applicant. Excess business\n               is that portion of a risk above the limits of that which the\n               agent\u2019s own insurer will accept. A licensed life agent may\n               place excess or rejected risks with any other authorized\n               insurer without being required to secure an appointment\n               as to such other insurer.\n             \uf09f Excess charges occur when an agent knowingly collects\n               money for a premium or an additional charge for\n               insurance that is not provided for in the policy.\n             \uf09f ERISA supersedes Florida state law relating to employee\n               retirement plans. The savings clause in ERISA protects\n               the following areas of state regulation:\n                         Insurance\n                         Banking\no Securities Agent Responsibilities\n\n\f             \uf09f The Solicitation Law: spells out the information and\n                procedures required of agents and insurers when\n                proposing life insurance to a prospective buyer;\n             \uf09f Replacement Rule: sets forth the requirements and\n                procedures to be followed by insurance companies and\n                agents when a proposal is being made in which a\n                prospective life insurance buyer will be replacing existing\n                insurance contracts with the proposed new insurance;\n             \uf09f Code of Ethics: establishes a broad outline defining\n                appropriate and inappropriate business behavior for life\n                insurance agents;\n             \uf09f Replacement is strictly regulated and requires full\n                disclosure by both the agent and the replacing insurance\n                company. Replacement regulations exists to assure that\n                purchasers receive specified information and it also\n                reduces the opportunity for misrepresentation.\n             \uf09f Duties of the replacing agent:\no Present to the applicant a Notice Regarding Replacement that is\n  signed by both the applicant and the agent.

A policy summary or\n  ledger statement containing policy data on the proposed life\n  insurance or annuity must be included.\n             \uf09f The replacement of existing life insurance policies with\n               new contracts of life insurance requires a written\n               Comparison and Summary Statement at the\n               policyowner's request.\n             \uf09f An agent's attempt to stop the replacement of an\n               existing life insurance policy or annuity is known as\n               conservation.\n             \uf09f Instead of a policy, the participants under a group plan\n               are issued certificates of insurance as evidence that they\n               have coverage. Each person insured under a Group Life\n               insurance policy is a certificate holder.\n             \uf09f In Florida, group life policies must contain a conversion\n               privilege that allows for conversion to an individual policy\n               for a specified period of time. Converted individual\n               policies do not require evidence of insurability.\n             \uf09f Participants are given a period of time, known as the\n               eligibility period, to join the group plan. Other plans use\n               an open enrollment period, in which case all new\n               employees must wait until the next enrollment period\n\n\f  before joining the group plan. In Florida, there is no\n  minimum number of insureds required for a group life\n  insurance policy.\n\uf09f The employees eligible for group insurance under the\n  policy shall be all of the employees of the employer.\n\uf09f In the event of a termination of a group life plan or\n  termination of a covered employee, a person covered by\n  a group policy has the right to convert such coverage to\n  an individual policy within the conversion period (31\n  days) without proving insurability. If this right is\n  exercised, the employee is responsible for the payment\n  of premium.\n\uf09f There are no restrictions regarding the assignment of\n  coverage under a group life insurance policy.\n\uf09f An insurer must notify each certificate holder (employee)\n  when the master policy has expired or is being cancelled.\n  The insurer may take such action through the\n  policyholder (employer).\n\uf09f Fraternal life insurance organizations are nonprofit\n  providers of life insurance that is covered by a special\n  section of the Florida insurance code.\n\uf09f The following entities for selling life insurance are legal\n  in the State of Florida;\n                Personal producing general agencies\n                Independent agency systems\n                Career agency systems\n\uf09f In a noncontributory group, the policy must cover 100%\n  of eligible persons.\n\n\f             \uf09f Viatical Settlements allows someone with a terminal\n               illness to sell their existing life insurance policy to a third\n               party for a percentage of the face value. To receive a\n               percentage of the policy face value, an owner of a life\n               policy may sell the policy to a viatical settlement\n               provider. The new owner continues to make the premium\n               payments and will eventually collect the entire death\n               benefit. Viatical settlement brokers must be licensed\n               before conducting any viatical transactions. Proceeds of\n               the viatical settlement contract could be subject to the\n               claims of creditors.\n             \uf09f An agent who wants to sell Variable annuities must be\n               licensed by the state, which includes examinations in Life\n               and Variable contracts.\n             \uf09f Standards and procedures are in existence to ensure that\n               anyone looking to purchase, exchange, or replace an\n               annuity is properly informed and the recommendations\n               given to them are in their best interests. The intended\n               goal of this regulation is a consumer who has had their\n               insurance needs and financial objectives properly\n               addressed."
