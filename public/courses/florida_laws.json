The agent's primary responsibility in the application process is to the insurer.\n\nTwisting occurs when an insurance agent convinces a policyowner to cancel their current policy so that they can purchase new life insurance policy with another company. This would involve the agent using misrepresentations or incomplete comparisons of the advantages and disadvantages of the two policies. Twisting is a form of misrepresentation and is illegal.\n\nChurning occurs when an agent has a policyholder replace one policy for another with the same company for the sole purpose of making more commission. This can involve using the cash value and/or dividends of an existing policy to purchase another policy with the same insurer. This normally is done using misrepresentation or deception and is not in the policyholder\u2019s best interest.\n\nSliding occurs when an agent tells an applicant that in order to get the product they want, they are required by law to get an additional product as well. It can also mean falsely representing to an applicant that specific coverage is included in the policy applied for with no additional charge.\n\nCoercion is when an agent uses physical or mental force, with the intent of convincing an applicant to buy insurance.\n\nMisrepresentation is when an agent uses publications, sales materials, or makes statements that are false, misleading, or deceptive to unfairly influence the purchase of a policy.\n\nDefamation occurs when an oral or written statement is maliciously made that is intended to injure a person in the insurance business or be critical and misleading about the financial condition of a person or company.\n\nFraud occurs when someone intentionally deceives another with the intent to gain financially.\n\nIt is an illegal practice to unfairly discriminate against a person in any way on an insurance-related matter. An example would be providing different terms of coverage for different policyowners in the same risk classification. Fair discrimination is necessary for the issuance of life insurance policies, which is based on mortality.\n\nControlled business is coverage written by an agent on his/her own life, health, property, immediate family, or business associates. Most states will not issue a license to a person if it is determined that their primary purpose is to write controlled business.\n\nRebating happens when an agent refunds part of their commission, or exchanges anything of value to induce someone to purchase an insurance policy. Rebating is allowed in Florida if the agent rebates insureds in the same actuarial class.\n\nIt is an illegal practice to falsely advertise insurance products or publish misleading information about its insurance coverage. This includes making false statements about the financial condition of an insurer.\n\nThe following acts, omissions, or practices are defined as unfair and deceptive claim settlement practices, when knowingly committed or performed with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice, and are prohibited:\n\n\u2022 Misrepresenting to insured\u2019s pertinent facts or policy provisions relating to coverage at issue\n\n\u2022 Failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to an insurance claim\n\n\u2022 Failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for prompt investigation and processing of insured\u2019s claims\n\n\u2022 Failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss statements are completed and submitted by insured",

COBRA guarantees that the participant can continue the group coverage (at their own expense) at group rates if their participation in the group plan is terminated because of a qualifying event.\n\n\u2022 Qualifying events: include the death of the employee; termination of employment (except for termination because of gross misconduct); or a reduction in work hours, which results in the participant no longer qualifying for group coverage.\n\n\u2022 It is important to remember that COBRA benefits apply only to group health insurance, not group life insurance.\n\n\u2022 Employees who have been covered under a group health plan for at least 3 months before their termination are eligible to continue their coverage under COBRA. They must request continuation within 31 days following termination.\n\n\u2022 Florida's Health Insurance Coverage Continuation Act (Mini COBRA) applies to employers who employ less than 20 employees.\n\n\u25e6 The purpose of the Florida Employee Health Care Access Act is to make group health insurance available to employers with 50 or fewer employees.\n\n\u2022 Florida Healthy Kids offers health insurance for children ages 5-18.

      "content": "\u2022 Occasionally, dental insurance is part of a health benefits package with a single deductible called an integrated deductible, applying to both medical and dental coverages. More often, however, dental coverage and claims are handled separately with a separate deductible. There also may be a probationary period in group dental insurance to help hold down coverage for preexisting conditions. Some dental policies are scheduled, meaning benefits are limited to specified maximums per procedure, with first dollar coverage. Most, however, are comprehensive policies that work in much the same way as comprehensive medical expense coverage. In addition to deductibles, coinsurance and maximums may also affect the level of benefits payable under a dental plan.\n\nPATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (PPACA OR ACA)\n\n\u2022 Exchanges: Created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health reform bill to help individuals and small businesses purchase health insurance coverage. The purposes of the exchange include:\n\n\u25e6 Reduce the number of uninsured in the state\n\n\u2022 Facilitate the purchase and sale of qualified health plans in the individual market\n\n\u2022 Assist qualified employers in the state in enrolling their employees in qualified health plans\n\n\u2022 Assists individuals in accessing public programs, premium tax credits, and cost-sharing reductions\n\n\u2022 Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the health insurance exchange will perform all of the following roles:\n\n\u25e6 Certify health plans as qualified, based on pre-determined criteria\n\n\u2022 Utilize individual, unique formats for presenting health benefit plan options\n\n\u2022 Verify and resolve inconsistent information provided to the exchange by applicants\n\n\u2022 Essential health benefits\n\n\u25e6 Beginning January 1, 2014, the exchange shall allow any qualified plans that meet the minimum standards established by the exchange to be offered in the exchange. All plans must include the following: Ambulatory patient services Emergency services Hospitalization Maternity and newborn care Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment\n\n\u2022 Prescription drugs Rehabilitative services and devices Laboratory services Preventative and wellness services and chronic disease management\n\n\u2022 Pediatric services, including oral and vision care\n\n\u2022 Metal levels\n\nThere are four tiers of \"qualifying health plans\" you or your employer can purchase on the exchange. They range from lower quality, but more affordable \"Bronze plans\", to \"Silver plans\" to a more expensive plan with better coverage called a \"Gold plan\". There is also a \"Platinum plan\" which is the highest quality and cost plan. Lower premium plans will have higher deductibles, less benefits and larger out of pocket costs.\n\nThe actuarial level is calculated as the percentage of total average cost for covered benefits that a plan will cover.\n\n\u2022 Bronze Plans: 60% actuarial level of coverage provided\n\n\u2022 Silver Plans: 70% actuarial level of coverage provided\n\n\u2022 Gold Plans: 80% actuarial level of coverage provided\n\n\u2022 Platinum Plans: 90% actuarial level of coverage provided\n\n\u2022 Health plans cannot limit or deny benefits or deny coverage for a child younger than age 19 because of preexisting conditions. This applies to both group and individual policies.\n\n\u2022 The ACA prohibits health plans from putting lifetime dollar limits on most benefits that are received by an insured.\n\n\u2022 For plans starting on or after September 23, 2012, but not before January 1, 2014, the annual dollar limit is $2 million. After January 1, 2014, there are no annual dollar limits\n\n\u2022 Plans are allowed to put an annual dollar limit on health care services that are not considered essential\n\n\u25e6 Grandfathered plans are plans that were purchased before March 23, 2010. These plans do not have to follow the ACA\u2019s rules and regulations or offer the same benefits, rights and protections as new plans.\n\n\u2022 An exception to this is, a grandfathered plan cannot impose lifetime limits on how much health care coverage people may receive\n\n\u2022 Grandfathered health plans may lose their grandfathered status if the insurer significantly raises coinsurance charges, deductibles, or co- payment charges.\n\nOTHER ACA REQUIREMENTS\n\n\u2022 As defined by the Affordable Care Act, the MAXIMUM amount an individual can contribute to a Flexible Savings Account is $2,500\n\n\u2022 Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), parents can insure their dependent adult children up to their 26th birthday, even if they are married or not living with their parents",
