      "content": "HEALTH INSURANCE\n\nThe Role of Insurance\n   \uf0a7 In general terms, insurance can be defined as a legal contract that transfers an uncertain risk from one\n     party to another.\n   \uf0a7 Insurance can also be described as the transfer of risk through the pooling or accumulation of funds\n     because it distributes one person\u2019s risk among a large number of people.\n   \uf0a7 The insured transfers the possibility of suffering a large financial loss to an insurer in return for paying\n     a relatively small, contractually defined premium.\n   \uf0a7 Insurance helps to reduce the financial uncertainty of the policy owner that could otherwise result\n     from future losses.\n   \uf0a7 Insurance has become an essential element of any financial planning process.\n\n  Benefits and Costs of Insurance to Society\n   \uf0a7 Insurance policies indemnify policyholders.\n   \uf0a7 To indemnify means to restore a person to the financial position they experienced prior to the insured\n     loss.\n   \uf0a7 The ability of insurance to eliminate the potential cost of unexpected or untimely losses is arguably its\n     most significant advantage.\n\nTypes of Insurance Companies\n   \uf0a7 There are many ways to classify insurance carriers, including:\n      \u2012 Where the company was formed\n      \u2012 How ownership is structured\n      \u2012 Whether the company is authorized to conduct business in a given state, or\n      \u2012 Whether the insurer is a commercial carrier or government provider\n\n  Private versus Government Insurers\n   \uf0a7 Private citizens own commercial insurers, which may be proprietary or cooperative.\n   \uf0a7 Federal and state governments also offer a variety of coverages, commonly referred to as social\n     insurance.\n   \uf0a7 Federal and state-owned government insurers either:\n       \u2012 Cover catastrophic perils or losses that are not insurable by commercial insurers, or\n       \u2012 Cover insurable risks in competition with, or instead of, commercial insurers.\n   \uf0a7 Examples of social insurance programs include:\n       \u2012 Social Security\n       \u2012 Original Medicare\n       \u2012 Medicaid\n       \u2012 SGLI and VGLI\n       \u2012 National Flood Insurance Program\n       \u2012 Federal Crop Insurance Corporation\n\n         Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fPrivate (Commercial) Insurance Companies\n \uf0a7 Companies that sell more than one line of insurance are referred to as multi-line insurers.\n \uf0a7 A company that only sells one line of insurance is a monoline insurer.\n \uf0a7 Stock and mutual companies are both be considered commercial insurers, and, as such, both can write\n   life, health, property, and casualty insurance.\n \uf0a7 Regulators require companies to maintain a certain percentage of surplus revenue as reserves to pay\n   future claims. These funds are referred to as statutory reserves.\n\nStock Companies \u2013 Non-Participating\n \uf0a7 A stock insurance company is one that\u2019s owned by private investors (stockholders or shareholders).\n \uf0a7 Stock insurers are incorporated under state laws, are structured like any other corporation, and their\n   goal is to make profits for their shareholders.\n \uf0a7 Typically, they\u2019re publicly traded.\n \uf0a7 A portion of the company\u2019s profits may be distributed to shareholders as dividends.\n \uf0a7 Stock insurers issue non-participating insurance policies.\n \uf0a7 Non-participating policies don\u2019t pay policy dividends.\n \uf0a7 Purchasing a non-participating policy does NOT give policy owners any other privileges of\n   ownership.\n \uf0a7 Post-tax earnings (earned surplus) that are retained by a company are considered equity and are\n   owned by the shareholders.\n\nMutual Companies \u2013 Participating\n \uf0a7 Mutual insurance companies are also organized under state laws but are owned by the\n   policyholders.\n \uf0a7 Policyholders have the right to vote for the board of directors.\n \uf0a7 Mutual insurance companies are considered participating insurers because policy owners receive a\n   share of surplus revenue in the form of policy dividends.\n \uf0a7 Mutual insurers hold such excess earnings as a divisible surplus.\n \uf0a7 Mutual insurers return this surplus to their policy owners by paying policy dividends.\n \uf0a7 Policy dividends represent a refund of that portion of the premium remaining after a company has set\n   aside the necessary reserves.\n \uf0a7 In some cases, a stock company may be converted into a mutual company through a process that\u2019s\n   referred to as mutualization.\n\nAssessment Mutual Insurers\n \uf0a7 Assessment mutual companies are classified by the method in which they charge premiums.\n \uf0a7 Pure assessment mutual companies charge no premium in advance; instead, each member is assessed\n   a portion of the losses that occur.\n \uf0a7 Advance premium assessment companies charge premiums but levy assessments if the premium is\n   insufficient.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fFraternal Benefit Societies\n \uf0a7 Fraternal societies are not-for-profit organizations noted for their social, charitable, and benevolent\n   activities.\n \uf0a7 Fraternal membership is based on religion, nationality, or ethnicity.\n \uf0a7 Fraternal societies also issue insurance covering their members.\n \uf0a7 To be characterized as a fraternal benefit society, the organization must have the following\n   characteristics:\n     \u2012 It must be non-profit.\n     \u2012 It must have a lodge system, including ritualistic work and a representative form of government.\n     \u2012 It must exist for reasons other than obtaining insurance.\n\nReciprocal Insurers\n \uf0a7 A reciprocal insurer is an unincorporated organization in which individual members (also referred to\n   as subscribers) agree to insure one another.\n \uf0a7 Unlike mutual or stock insurers, reciprocal policyholders don\u2019t transfer these risks to a separate\n   corporate entity. Each policyholder individually assumes a share of the risk.\n \uf0a7 This arrangement makes the reciprocal insurer a risk-sharing mechanism rather than a form of risk\n   transfer.\n \uf0a7 Policyholders receive policy dividends as well as their share of the company surplus (capital) if they\n   terminate their membership.\n \uf0a7 An attorney-in-fact handles transactions for the reciprocal insurer.\n\nRisk Retention Groups (RRGs)\n \uf0a7 A risk retention group is a specialized insurance company that\u2019s created to provide liability\n   insurance for individuals and entities with a common bond.\n \uf0a7 The federal law requires risk retention groups to follow the laws of their home state.\n \uf0a7 Risk retention groups are only licensed in their state of domicile. In other jurisdictions, federal law\n   prevails.\n \uf0a7 Risk retention groups hold on to risks and process claims\n\nRisk Purchasing Groups (RPGs)\n \uf0a7 As with a risk retention group, a risk purchasing group provides insurance for individuals and entities\n   with a common bond.\n \uf0a7 RPGs differ from RRGs because they purchase coverage for their members from an insurance\n   company rather than act as the insurer.\n \uf0a7 The risk purchasing group becomes a master policyholder, and its members receive certificates of\n   insurance.\n\nReinsurers and Retention Limits\n \uf0a7 Reinsurers insure other insurance companies that seek to limit the loss they would face if a substantial\n   claim became payable.\n \uf0a7 The insurance company that transfers its loss exposure (risk) to another insurer is referred to as the\n   primary insurer or ceding company.\n \uf0a7 The portion of the risk that a ceding insurer retains is considered the net retention.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f   \uf0a7 The insurance company that accepts the risk is the reinsurer (also referred to as the assuming\n     company).\n   \uf0a7 There are two types of reinsurance contracts:\n       \u2012 When two companies arrange for an automatic sharing risk based on specific criteria, it\u2019s\n          considered treaty reinsurance.\n       \u2012 When a primary insurer seeks reinsurance for a specific exposure without an ongoing agreement,\n          it\u2019s considered facultative reinsurance.\n\n  Captive Insurers\n   \uf0a7 A captive insurer is established and owned by a parent firm(s) to cover the parent\u2019s loss exposure.\n\n  Surplus Lines Insurance\n   \uf0a7 Surplus lines carriers provide types of coverage that are not available through authorized carriers.\n   \uf0a7 Consumers place the coverage through a surplus lines broker for high, substandard, or unusual risks\n     that are rejected for coverage in the authorized market.\n\n  Lloyd\u2019s of London\n   \uf0a7 Lloyd\u2019s of London is a syndicate of individuals that individually underwrite insurance but is NOT an\n     insurer.\n   \uf0a7 Lloyd\u2019s function is to provide coverages that may otherwise be unavailable.\n\n  Self-Insurers\n   \uf0a7 A self-insurer establishes a self-funded plan to cover potential losses.\n   \uf0a7 A self-insurer will often seek an insurance company that will provide insurance above a specified\n     maximum loss level.\n\nInsurer Classifications\n  Insurers Classified by Authorization\n   \uf0a7 An insurer with a certificate of authority that allows it to do business in a particular state is referred\n     to as an authorized or admitted insurer.\n   \uf0a7 Generally, an unauthorized (non-admitted) insurance company is not permitted to conduct\n     insurance operations unless it qualifies as a surplus lines carrier.\n\n  Insurer Classified According to Domicile\n   \uf0a7 A domestic insurer is organized and incorporated in the state in which it writes business.\n       \u2012 For example, if XYZ Insurance Company is incorporated in Wisconsin and writes policies in\n          Wisconsin, it\u2019s a domestic company in that state.\n   \uf0a7 A foreign insurer is authorized in one state but organized and incorporated under a different state\u2019s\n     laws.\n       \u2012 For example, if XYZ Insurance Company is incorporated in Wisconsin but transacts insurance in\n          Iowa, it acts as a foreign insurance company in Iowa.\n\n         Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f   \uf0a7 An alien insurer is an insurer that\u2019s organized under the laws of a different nation.\n      \u2012 For example, Sun Financial Services of Toronto, Canada, is an alien insurer.\n\nDepartments within an Insurance Company\n   \uf0a7 The marketing or sales division is responsible for increasing the number of prospective applicants.\n   \uf0a7 The sales department completes applications and conducts face-to-face appointments with\n     prospective buyers.\n   \uf0a7 The underwriting department reviews applications, conducts investigations, determines whether to\n     issue coverage, and assigns risk classifications.\n   \uf0a7 The claims department investigates, processes, and pays claims.\n   \uf0a7 The actuarial department calculates policy rates, reserves, and dividends.\n\nKey People Within an Insurance Company\n  Producers\n   \uf0a7 The term \u201cProducer\u201d refers to individuals who are licensed by the state regulatory authority to\n     solicit, sell, or transact the placement of insurance products with the buying public.\n   \uf0a7 Licensed producers act in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of both their insurers and their clients.\n   \uf0a7 The various types of producers include:\n       \u2012 Agents represent one or more insurers under the terms of an appointment contract.\n       \u2012 Brokers represent themselves and the insureds.\n       \u2012 Solicitors are licensed in some states to represent a producer and solicit prospective applicants to\n           meet and discuss their insurance needs with that producer.\n       \u2012 Service Representatives work in some states under a limited authority.\n             \u2022 They\u2019re insurance company employees in some states that hold a limited license.\n             \u2022 They don\u2019t earn commissions for sales.\n             \u2022 They\u2019re not required to be licensed unless they solicit, countersign policies, or collect\n                  premiums from policy owners.\n\n  Underwriters\n   \uf0a7 Underwriters identify, assess, examine, and classify the amount of risk represented by an applicant.\n   \uf0a7 Underwriters approve or decline applications and determine the cost of insurance.\n\n  Actuaries\n   \uf0a7 Actuaries calculate policy rates, reserves, and dividends.\n\n  Adjusters\n   \uf0a7 Adjusters investigate insurance claims to determine whether they should be settled or denied.\n   \uf0a7 A public adjuster is compensated for acting on behalf of an insured regarding the settlement of an\n     insurance claim.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fHow Insurance is Sold\n   \uf0a7 Most consumers purchase insurance through licensed producers who market insurance products and\n     services to the public.\n   \uf0a7 Typically, these producers are agents who are appointed to represent one or more insurance\n     companies.\n   \uf0a7 Agents can bind insurance; in other words, they can commit the insurer to cover a risk exposure\u2014at\n     least temporarily.\n   \uf0a7 Some consumers may work with brokers who work for insureds to place coverage. Brokers are not\n     appointed by the insurer and don\u2019t have the authority to bind coverage.\n   \uf0a7 In a sales transaction, agents represent the insurer, while brokers represent the buyer.\n\n  Career Agency System\n   \uf0a7 A career agency is often a branch of a major stock or mutual insurance company.\n   \uf0a7 A career agency may exist to represent an insurer in a specific geographical area or market.\n   \uf0a7 A general agent (GA) typically runs a career agency.\n   \uf0a7 The GA recruits, trains, and supervises career insurance agents.\n   \uf0a7 The GA has a vested right in any business that\u2019s written by those agents who sell for the agency.\n  Managerial System\n   \uf0a7 The managerial system is a form of career agency.\n   \uf0a7 The insurance company hires a salaried branch manager to run the agency.\n   \uf0a7 The branch manager supervises agents and receives a salary and a bonus based on meeting sales and\n     recruiting goals.\n\n  Personal Producing General Agency System\n   \uf0a7 The personal producing general agency (PPGA) system resembles the career agency system, but\n     PPGAs don\u2019t recruit, train, or supervise career agents.\n   \uf0a7 A personal producing general agent focuses on selling insurance in an assigned market or geographic\n     area.\n   \uf0a7 PPGAs are generally responsible for maintaining their own offices and administrative staff.\n   \uf0a7 Agents who are hired by a PPGA are considered employees of the PPGA, not the insurer.\n\n  Independent Agency System\n   \uf0a7 The independent agency system is not tied to any particular insurance company.\n   \uf0a7 Independent agents represent any number of insurance companies through contractual agreements.\n\n  Other Methods of Selling Insurance\n   \uf0a7 A large volume of business is also marketed through direct selling and mass marketing methods.\n   \uf0a7 Insurance companies that use the direct selling method deal directly with consumers.\n   \uf0a7 Direct sellers use vending machines, advertisements, or salaried sales representatives who are\n     licensed.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f   \uf0a7 Insurance is also sold through mass marketing techniques, such as over the Internet, newspapers,\n     magazines, radio, and television ads.\n   \uf0a7 Mass marketing methods provide exposure to many consumers, often using direct selling methods\n     with occasional follow-up by agents.\n\nEvolution of Industry Oversight\n   \uf0a7 The insurance industry is regulated by a number of authorities, including some within the industry\n     itself.\n   \uf0a7 The primary purpose of this regulation is to promote public welfare.\n\n  Federal Court Cases and Legislation Affecting Insurance Industry\n  Regulation\n   \uf0a7 In the 1868 case of Paul v. Virginia, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the sale and issuance\n     of insurance is not interstate commerce, thereby upholding a state\u2019s right to regulate insurance.\n   \uf0a7 In the 1944 case, the United States v. Southeastern Underwriters Association (SEUA), the United\n     States Supreme Court revisited the issue of state versus federal regulation.\n       \u2012 The Supreme Court reversed Paul v. Virginia and ruled that the insurance industry is a form of\n           interstate commerce.\n       \u2012 The Court determined that the federal government should regulate insurance.\n   \uf0a7 In 1945, Congress passed Public Law 15\u2014the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The McCarran-Ferguson\n     Act created the following:\n       \u2012 It called for the states to continue their regulation of the insurance industry because it was in the\n           public\u2019s best interest.\n       \u2012 It also made possible the application of federal antitrust laws so far as state laws did not regulate\n           such activity.\n       \u2012 Today, the insurance industry is both state-regulated and in conformity with federal antitrust\n           requirements.\n       \u2012 Any person who violates the McCarran-Ferguson act faces a fine of $10,000 or up to one year in\n           prison.\n   \uf0a7 In 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act was enacted to protect privacy by requiring the fair and\n     accurate reporting of consumer information and for insurers to inform applicants about any\n     investigations being made\n       \u2012 If insurers deny coverage or charge higher rates due to a consumer report, the applicant must\n           receive the name of the relevant reporting agency.\n       \u2012 Insurers that fail to comply are liable for actual and punitive damages.\n       \u2012 The maximum penalty for obtaining consumer reports under false pretenses is a $5,000 fine and\n           up to one year in prison.\n   \uf0a7 In 1994, Congress amended Sections 1033 and 1034 of the United States Code (USC) regarding\n     Fraud and False Statements.\n       \u2012 It\u2019s a criminal offense for felons who are convicted of crimes involving dishonesty or a breach of\n           trust to participate in the insurance business without a \u201cLetter of Written Consent\u201d from their\n           state insurance regulators.\n       \u2012 The law makes it illegal to lie, falsify, or conceal information from a federal official.\n       \u2012 Any person that engages in intentionally unfair or deceptive insurance practices is violating\n           federal law.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f     \u2012 Other violations include embezzling money, misappropriating insurance premiums, and writing\n         threatening letters to insurance offices.\n     \u2012 The punishment for violation is a fine of up to $50,000, up to 15 years in prison, and license\n         revocation.\n \uf0a7 In 1999, the Financial Services Modernization Act removed the barriers that kept commercial\n   banks, investment banks, retail brokerages, and insurance companies from engaging in each other\u2019s\n   lines of business.\n \uf0a7 In 2001, the USA PATRIOT Act was adopted in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11\n   terrorist attacks. The law aims to detect, deter, and disrupt terrorist efforts and funding while\n   prosecuting international money laundering.\n \uf0a7 In 2003, the Do Not Call Implementation Act implemented the Do Not Call Registry.\n     \u2012 The Act allows consumers to list their phones so that telemarketers (including insurers) cannot\n         legally make solicitation calls.\n     \u2012 Calls made on behalf of charities, political organizations, and surveys are exempt.\n\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)\n \uf0a7 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is an industry association that consists\n   of all state insurance regulators.\n \uf0a7 The NAIC brings together regulators and industry personnel on committees that study various aspects\n   of insurance practices, laws, and regulations.\n \uf0a7 The organization has four broad objectives:\n     1. To encourage regulatory uniformity among the states\n     2. To promote efficiency in the administration of laws and regulations\n     3. To protect policy owners and consumer interests, and\n     4. To preserve state regulation of the insurance business\n \uf0a7 The NAIC recognizes that state laws regarding insurance marketing, trade practices, and regulations\n   may vary, but share more similarities than differences. Model Acts and Model Regulations developed\n   by the NAIC provide a template for individual state legislators and regulators.\n \uf0a7 The NAIC is not a regulatory organization. Instead, the models it creates provide a common\n   framework for state officials that allow the various governing bodies to meet the specific needs of\n   their respective jurisdictions while helping to streamline the legislative and administrative processes\n   and helping to standardize the outcomes.\nUnfair Trade Practices Act (Model)\n \uf0a7 Most jurisdictions have adopted their own version of the NAIC model \u201cUnfair Trade Practices Act.\u201d\n \uf0a7 This Act gives the head of each state insurance department the power to investigate insurance\n   companies and producers.\n \uf0a7 It authorizes them to issue cease and desist orders and impose penalties.\n \uf0a7 The Act also gives officers the authority to seek a court injunction to restrain unfair activities, such as\n   misrepresentation and false advertising, coercion and intimidation, and unfair discrimination.\nNAIC Advertising Code\n \uf0a7 Many states also subscribe to the NAIC\u2019s Model Advertising Code, which labels certain words and\n   phrases as misleading by their very nature.\n \uf0a7 These misleading words or phrases can never be used in any insurance advertisement.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fThe National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL)\n  \uf0a7 In 1969, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL) was formed. The NCOIL\u2019s\n    principal membership is comprised of state legislators from around the nation that serve on state\n    insurance and financial institutions committees.\n  \uf0a7 As with the NAIC, NCOIL works to preserve state regulation of the industry, but it also works to\n    educate public policymakers on related issues.\n  \uf0a7 NCOIL also writes model laws.\n\nThe National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors\n(NAIFA)and The National Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU)\n  \uf0a7 These organizations created a Code of Ethics which details the expectations of agents in their duties\n    toward clients.\nAgent Marketing and Sales Practices Some standards in various states include:\n  \uf0a7 Selling to Needs: An ethical agent learns the client\u2019s needs and determines the best way to address\n    those needs.\n  \uf0a7 Suitability of Recommended Products: Correlation between a recommended product and the\n    client\u2019s needs and capabilities\n  \uf0a7 Full and Accurate Disclosure: Inform clients about all aspects of recommended products.\n  \uf0a7 Documentation: The ethical agent documents each client meeting and transaction.\n  \uf0a7 Client Service: The ethical agent knows that a sale doesn\u2019t mark the end of a relationship with a\n    client but rather the beginning.\nProducer Responsibilities:\n  \uf0a7 Provide customers with the best service possible.\n  \uf0a7 Solicit new business for their companies by helping clients acquire products from application to\n    policy delivery.\n  \uf0a7 Guide customers to the right products that meet their needs and maintain a relationship with them.\n  \uf0a7 Build a business by keeping current customers satisfied and actively seeking referrals.\n\nRating Services\n  \uf0a7 Rating services help to publicize the financial health of insurers.\n  \uf0a7 The financial strength (solvency) and stability of an insurance company are two vitally important\n    factors.\n  \uf0a7 The PRIMARY purpose of a rating service company (e.g., A.M. Best) is to determine an insurer\u2019s\n    financial strength.\n  \uf0a7 Financial strength can be evaluated by examining a company\u2019s reserves and liquidity.\n      \u2012 Reserves are the accounting measurement of an insurer\u2019s future obligations to its policyholders.\n         They are classified as liabilities for the insurance company.\n      \u2012 Liquidity indicates a company\u2019s ability to make unpredictable payouts to policy owners.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 .

      "content": "\uf0a7 In generic terms, insurance is defined as the transfer of risk from one party to another in exchange for\n      a fee (premium) by means of a legal contract.\n    \uf0a7 Insurance spreads each insured\u2019s risk of loss across many people participating in an insurance\n      company\u2019s risk pool by paying a premium.\n    \uf0a7 Insurance reduces financial risk and spreads the risk of loss from one individual to many.\n\n  Principle of Indemnity (Indemnification)\n    \uf0a7 Operating on the \u201cPrinciple of Indemnification,\u201d the goal of an insurance carrier is to \u201crestore\u201d\n      insureds to their original financial position following losses.\n    \uf0a7 The same principle stipulates that insureds will not profit or gain by their losses. In other words, they\n      will not receive more than they lost.\n    \uf0a7 Most accident, health, property, and casualty insurance contracts are all contracts of indemnity.\n\n  Law of Large Numbers (Spread of Risk)\n  The law of large numbers holds that, based on experience, the greater the number of homogenous loss\n  exposures, the more likely the overall likelihood of loss can be predicted.\n    \uf0a7 The law of large numbers does NOT predict whether an individual suffers a loss.\n    \uf0a7 The law of large numbers helps predict the losses that those in the risk pool will suffer in the\n      aggregate.\n        For example, let\u2019s assume that a carrier insures one million people against accidental\n        death. In this case, the carrier is more likely to accurately predict the number of\n        accidental deaths than a company that insures only 1,000 people against the same peril.\n\n  Adverse Selection\n    \uf0a7 Adverse selection is defined as the tendency for higher-than-average risks to seek out insurance more\n      frequently than those who are lower risk.\n    \uf0a7 If an insurer suffers a financial loss due to adverse selection, it has inaccurately calculated the risk of\n      loss and consequently charged inadequate premiums. Companies must avoid adverse selection to be\n      profitable and stay in business. Sound and competent underwriting may reduce the chance of adverse\n      selection.\n\nPerils, Loss, and Hazards\n  Perils (CAUSES of Loss)\n    \uf0a7 A peril is the immediate and specific cause of a loss. Each line of insurance covers a different set of\n      perils and losses.\n    \uf0a7 Accident and health insurance policies cover losses that are caused by illnesses and accidents.\n\n         Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  \uf0a7 For life insurance and annuities, the primary covered peril is death.\n  \uf0a7 Life insurance protects against premature death.\n  \uf0a7 Annuities protect income when a person\u2019s life span is greater than the statistical average, and the\n    insured would otherwise outlive his assets.\n\nNamed Perils versus Special (Open) Perils\n  \uf0a7 Insurance contracts that cover Specified or Named Perils will individually list perils that they cover.\n  \uf0a7 If a loss is caused by a peril that\u2019s not listed within the insurance policy, then the loss is not covered.\n      For example, an accidental death and dismemberment policy only covers certain losses,\n      and only those due to accidents. By naming and defining specific causes of loss, a named-\n      peril policy defines covered losses narrowly.\n  \uf0a7 Insurance contracts that use a Special or Open Peril definition of covered causes of loss offer\n    insurance that protects against a broad spectrum of potential losses. These policies start by stating that\n    they cover all direct causes of loss and then list any excluded perils.\n  \uf0a7 Any peril that\u2019s not explicitly excluded is covered.\n      For example, an individual disability income policy covers losses due to either illnesses or\n      accidents. They also cover job-related losses as well as those that are not.\n\nLoss\n  \uf0a7 A loss is defined as an unintended and unforeseen reduction or destruction of financial or economic\n    value.\n  \uf0a7 A loss can also be defined as either an accident or an occurrence.\n  \uf0a7 An accident is an unforeseen, unexpected, unintended, and sudden event, which occurs at a specific\n    time and specific place.\n  \uf0a7 An occurrence is any event that causes a loss. Occurrences include accidents, illnesses, and losses\n    that are caused by repeated or continuous exposure to conditions over time.\n[EXAM TIP: Every accident is an occurrence, but not every occurrence is an accident.]\n\n  \uf0a7 A Direct Loss results when a person is hurt, killed, or property is damaged or destroyed.\n  \uf0a7 The peril is the proximate cause of the direct loss.\n\n  \uf0a7 An Indirect Loss is also referred to as a \u201cConsequential Loss\u201d because the loss results from a direct\n    loss.\n      For example, if an individual suffers an injury that causes her to be disabled for six\n      months, her injury is a direct loss. The individual\u2019s loss of income, which occurs\n      because the injury results in her inability to work, is indirect.\n\n  \uf0a7 Loss exposure is the risk of a possible loss. Basically, any situation that presents the possibility of a\n    loss.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f   \uf0a7 Homogeneous exposure units are similar objects of insurance exposed to the same group of perils.\n   \uf0a7 A loss exposure consists of loss exposure units.\n\n  Hazards\n   \uf0a7 A hazard increases the possibility that a loss will occur.\n       Examples of hazards include icy roads, driving while intoxicated, and improperly stored\n       toxic waste.\n   \uf0a7 There are three types of hazards\u2014physical hazards, moral hazards, and morale hazards.\n\n   \uf0a7 Physical hazards are physical or tangible conditions existing in a manner that makes a loss more\n     likely to occur.\n       Poor health and ice on roads are examples of physical hazards.\n\n   \uf0a7 Moral hazards make a loss more likely to occur due to the dishonest character of the insured.\n   \uf0a7 Properly defined, a moral hazard occurs when the insured is much more intentioned and conscious of\n     participating in wrongdoing that\u2019s more likely to lead to a loss.\n       For example, a dishonest person is more likely to lie to their insurance company, both\n       on an application and when submitting a claim.\n       Negative habits such as drug use, alcohol abuse, and smoking are commonly associated\n       with moral hazards.\n\n   \uf0a7 Morale hazards arise from a state of mind related to the indifference of an insured to whatever loss\n     may occur.\n   \uf0a7 The insured unintentionally creates a loss situation because he doesn\u2019t care about loss prevention since\n     the property is insured.\n\nRisk\n   \uf0a7 Risk is defined as the potential or uncertainty for loss.\n\n  Types of Risk\n\n   \uf0a7 Speculative risks are not insurable because they offer the opportunity for gains as well as losses.\n\n   \uf0a7 Pure risks are insurable because there\u2019s only the potential for loss, not gain.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fElements of an Insurable Risk\n \uf0a7 In general, insurable risk must include the following elements:\n     \u2012 An insurable loss must be due to chance (accidental), which means that the cause must be\n        outside of an insured\u2019s control. This characteristic helps insurers avoid adverse selection.\n     \u2012 An insurable loss must be definite and measurable, which means that the time, place, and\n        amount are known.\n     \u2012 An insurable loss must be predictable, which means that the probability of loss in the future can\n        be calculated. There must be a sufficient number of homogeneous loss exposure units to do so.\n     \u2012 An insurable loss cannot be catastrophic, which means that a loss cannot be too big or\n        uncertain to calculate. The loss exposure must be reasonable.\n     \u2012 The loss exposure to be insured must be substantial.\n     \u2012 The premium cost must be economically feasible; it must be small relative to the covered loss\n        exposure.\n\nInsurance Risk Classifications\n \uf0a7 Typically, an insurer will place a risk into one of the following three classifications:\n    \u2012 Standard risks are considered to have an average potential for loss.\n    \u2012 Substandard risks have a higher-than-average potential for loss. Substandard risks may either\n       pay a higher premium for coverage or be declined altogether.\n    \u2012 Preferred risks are judged to be a better than average risk for an insurance company because\n        they have a lower-than-average potential for loss.\n\nRisk Management\n \uf0a7 The process of analyzing exposures that create risk and designing programs to handle them is referred\n   to as risk management.\n \uf0a7 Risk may be reduced or managed by purchasing an insurance contract.\n\nMethods of Handling Risk\n \uf0a7 Risk avoidance means eliminating an activity or condition that exposes a person to a type of loss or\n   specific perils.\n \uf0a7 Risk reduction is the process of taking deliberate actions to reduce the likelihood or severity of a loss.\n \uf0a7 Risk retention is a conscious strategy of maintaining reserves to address the risk of losses.\n \uf0a7 Risk transfer features a legal contract that transfers risk from one party to another. In general,\n   insurance contracts are risk transfer arrangements. They transfer the risk of loss defined in the policy\n   to the insurer in exchange for a known fee or premium.\n \uf0a7 Risk-sharing spreads risk among multiple parties. Each party assumes a portion of the risks covered\n   by the arrangement, such as with reciprocal insurance companies.\n\n \uf0a7 Risk pooling spreads risk by distributing the cost of possible losses over a large number of\n   individuals. It transfers risk from an individual to a group.\n\n \uf0a7 Reinsurance is defined as the transfer of risk from one insurer to one or more other insurers.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fPrevention\n \uf0a7 Another risk management tool that\u2019s available is loss prevention. Loss prevention involves taking\n   actions to eliminate damage or loss.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved"

      "content": "General Law of Contracts\n   \uf0a7 Insurance contracts are binding legal agreements between two parties\u2014a policyowner and insurer. In\n     most cases, the policyowner is also the insured. Some life insurance policies are not owned by the\n     person being insured.\n   \uf0a7 If an insurance exam asks for the identity of the party that enters into an agreement with an insurance\n     company when buying a policy, the proper answer is \u201cthe policyowner,\u201d even if \u201cthe insured\u201d is also\n     given as a choice.\n   \uf0a7 The only time \u201cthe insured\u201d is the correct answer is when \u201cpolicyowner\u201d (or \u201cpolicyholder\u201d) is not\n     given as a possible answer.\n   \uf0a7 The beneficiary is not a party to the contract.\n   \uf0a7 The following four essential elements must be contained in every contract for it to be legally valid and\n     binding (enforceable). We can remember them using the mnemonic \u201cC.L.O.C.\u201d.\n        1. Competent parties\n        2. Legal purpose\n        3. Offer and acceptance\n        4. Consideration\n   \uf0a7 The four elements can be remembered using the mnemonic \u201cC, L, O, C.\u201d\n\n  Competent Parties\n   \uf0a7 The parties to the contract must be legally competent and must possess the capacity to make binding\n     agreements.\n   \uf0a7 The parties must be mentally sound, sober, of sufficient age, and not disqualified on other legal grounds.\n   \uf0a7 Individuals that may be barred from entering into a legally binding contract include:\n       \u2012 Minors as defined by state law\n       \u2012 Insane or mentally incompetent individuals\n       \u2012 Individuals who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of application\n       \u2012 Persons who are forced or coerced into a contract\n       \u2012 Enemy aliens\n       \u2012 Convicts (based on state law)\n\n  Legal Purpose\n   \uf0a7 For a contract to be enforceable, the contract must have a legal purpose. The object of the contract\n     and the reason for the parties to enter into the agreement must be legal.\n\n  Offer and Acceptance\n   \uf0a7 Both parties to the insurance contract must agree to the contract terms before they become valid and\n     in-force.\n   \uf0a7 The first party that commits to the contract is offering to enter into a legally binding agreement.\n   \uf0a7 The second party\u2019s commitment is legally considered an acceptance of the offer.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f   \uf0a7 An offer plus an acceptance is often referred to as the agreement.\n   \uf0a7 When the applicant for an insurance policy submits a completed application and pays the initial\n     premium, she\u2019s making an offer. When the insurer issues the policy as requested, it accepts the offer.\n   \uf0a7 If a consumer submits an application without an initial premium, the consumer is NOT making an\n     offer because no transaction can be completed without the payment of the initial premium. Instead, the\n     consumer is asking the insurer to make an offer by issuing a policy. The consumer accepts the offer by\n     paying the initial premium.\n\n  Consideration\n   \uf0a7 For any agreement to be binding, both parties must provide each other with some item of value, which\n     is the definition of \u201cconsideration.\u201d\n   \uf0a7 An applicant\u2019s consideration is the premium paid and the representations (i.e., statements) made.\n   \uf0a7 The insurer\u2019s consideration is the promise to pay legitimate claims.\n   \uf0a7 Consideration is the binding force of any insurance policy.\n\nSpecial Features of Insurance Contracts\n  Aleatory Contract\n   \uf0a7 An insurance contract is an aleatory contract because one party may recover more in value than he\n     has paid.\n   \uf0a7 The value of the policyowner\u2019s potential benefit (i.e., claim payment) is generally higher than the\n     value (i.e., premium) that\u2019s received by the insurer.\n   \uf0a7 There\u2019s no guarantee that the insured will receive a benefit. Performance is based on an uncertain\n     future event involving unequal bargaining value.\n     For example, an individual who has a disability insurance policy will collect benefits if\n     she becomes disabled. However, if no disability occurs, benefits are not paid.\n     Another example illustrating the aleatory nature of insurance contracts is a life insurance\n     policy that pays out a $20,000 death benefit after only $100 of premiums were collected.\n\n  Contract of Adhesion\n   \uf0a7 Insurance policies are contracts of adhesion.\n   \uf0a7 They\u2019re contracts that are prepared by only one of the parties\u2014the insurance company.\n   \uf0a7 There\u2019s no negotiation regarding the terms. The insurer sets the terms, and the applicant can either\n     \u201ctake it or leave it.\u201d\n\n   \uf0a7 In any contract of adhesion, the party that dictates the contract terms must make those terms clear.\n   \uf0a7 The doctrine regarding ambiguities in a contract of adhesion favors the party that did not create the\n     contract terms. When it comes to insurance policies, the courts will rule in favor of the insured.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f \uf0a7 The doctrine of reasonable expectations stipulates that an insurance contract may be interpreted by a\n   \u201creasonable\u201d consumer to mean what the producer or insurer has indicated it means or what he has\n   interpreted or expected it to mean.\n\nUnilateral Contract\n \uf0a7 Insurance policies are unilateral contracts because only the insurer makes an enforceable promise.\n \uf0a7 Insurers promise to pay benefits upon the occurrence of a specific event, such as death or disability.\n \uf0a7 The applicant makes no promise to continue the policy and can cancel it at any time.\n \uf0a7 The insurer\u2019s promise remains in force as long as the policyowner pays the required premium.\n\n \uf0a7 Most forms of insurance are personal contracts because they\u2019re non-transferrable.\n \uf0a7 Insurance contracts always insure a person, even when they insure property. A homeowner\u2019s policy\n   doesn\u2019t merely cover a house; it also covers the person who owns the house. When the person sells the\n   house, the coverage cannot be transferred to the new owner.\n \uf0a7 Life insurance is an exception to this rule. Life insurance is NOT a personal contract.\n \uf0a7 Life insurance contracts can be treated as financial assets. They can be used collateral for loans and\n   can be sold to third parties under the terms of a viatical or senior settlement.\n\nConditional Contract\n \uf0a7 Insurance policies are conditional contracts because the insurance company\u2019s performance is\n   contingent on the occurrence of uncertain future events.\n \uf0a7 The insurer must only fulfill its promise to pay if a covered loss occurs while the policy is in force.\n \uf0a7 The insurer\u2019s obligations under the contract are conditioned on the performance of specific acts by the\n   insured or the beneficiary. For example, the insured must provide notice of claim and proof of loss.\n\nValued Contract or Indemnity Contract\n \uf0a7 Insurance policies indemnify an insured in one of two ways. Some policies have a fixed value, while\n   others have benefits that are tied to the loss of assets, income, or health.\n\n \uf0a7 A valued contract, such as life insurance, pays a stated sum regardless of the actual loss incurred.\n\n \uf0a7 An indemnity contract pays an amount which is equal to a loss that\u2019s identified in the policy.\n \uf0a7 Some contracts of indemnity are reimbursement policies that directly reimburse the insured for claim-\n   related expenses.\n \uf0a7 Other indemnity contracts define their benefits as a certain amount of money per day, week, or month\n   to offset a loss of revenue (as in a disability policy) or some portion of periodic expenses (such as\n   long-term care).\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  Insurable Interest\n   \uf0a7 Insurable interest can be defined as the kind of financial interest a person must have in themselves or\n     another person to purchase legally enforceable insurance coverage.\n   \uf0a7 Most policies require insurable interest to exist at the time of purchase and at the time of claim.\n   \uf0a7 For a life or health insurance contract, insurable interest is only required at the time of the application.\n     Insurable interest doesn\u2019t need to exist at the time of claim.\n   \uf0a7 To have \u201can insurable interest\u201d in oneself or another person, an individual must have a reasonable\n     expectation of benefiting from the other person\u2019s continued life. Conversely, she will suffer a financial\n     loss if the person becomes ill, suffers an injury, or dies.\n\nNegotiating and Issuing Insurance Policies\n   \uf0a7 An insurance policy is a written contract in which one party promises to compensate another against\n     loss from an unknown event.\n   \uf0a7 A policy rider or endorsement is a legal attachment which amends a policy.\n\n  Utmost Good Faith\n   \uf0a7 Utmost good faith means that the policyowner and the insurer both know all of the relevant\n     information that\u2019s material to the agreement. The critical concept is full disclosure.\n\n  Reasonable Expectations\n   \uf0a7 The Doctrine of Reasonable Expectations is the legal principle which stipulates that the terms of\n     contracts should be interpreted as may reasonably be expected when ambiguous.\n\n  Warranty\n   \uf0a7 A warranty is a statement that\u2019s guaranteed to be true in every respect. It becomes part of the contract\n     and can be grounds for revoking the agreement if found to be untrue.\n\n  Representation\n   \uf0a7 A representation is a statement which is made by the applicant and is considered to be true and\n     accurate to the best of the applicant\u2019s belief.\n   \uf0a7 A false statement made by an applicant that would influence an insurer in determining whether to\n     accept the risk is considered a material misrepresentation.\n\n  Concealment\n   \uf0a7 Concealment is defined as the failure or neglect by the applicant to disclose a known, material fact.\n   \uf0a7 An insurance company has the right to rescind the insurance contract in response to either an\n     intentional or unintentional concealment.\n   \uf0a7 The insurer must prove the concealment exists and that it\u2019s material to the insurance policy.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fVoid versus Voidable Contracts\n\n \u2022 For example, if a life insurance applicant asks his friend to impersonate him during a medical\n exam in hopes of qualifying for coverage, any resulting policy would be void. It would never be in\n effect because the insurance company doesn\u2019t have the right person\u2019s consideration. Also, it\n doesn\u2019t have medical data about the applicant which is necessary to underwrite the policy.\n\n \uf0a7 The injured party may have the right to terminate the agreement.\n\nFraud\n \uf0a7 Fraud is an intentional misrepresentation regarding a claim or policy application that a consumer\n   makes to obtain benefit payments or policy coverage under false pretenses.\n \uf0a7 Life insurance contracts cannot be voided after they have been in force for two years. After two years,\n   the policies become incontestable.\n \uf0a7 Guaranteed renewable health insurance policies usually have two or three years, depending on state\n   law. After this time, they also become incontestable.\n \uf0a7 The ability of insurers to void other health insurance policies due to fraud is not necessarily limited.\n   This will be addressed in the section titled \u201cTime Limit on Certain Defenses.\u201d\n\nParole Evidence Rule\n \uf0a7 The parole evidence rule limits a contract to its written terms. Oral statements that are made before\n   the formation of a contract are not admissible in court unless they become part of the written contract.\n\nWaiver\n \uf0a7 A waiver is the voluntary surrendering (giving up) of a known right.\n \uf0a7 A waiver is also defined as \u201cthe deliberate, voluntary, or intentional abandonment of a known right by\n   an insurer.\u201d\n \uf0a7 One example of an insurer waiving a right occurs if an incomplete application is mistakenly accepted.\n   Once the policy is issued, the insurer cannot contest a later claim based on the missing information.\n\nEstoppel\n \uf0a7 Estoppel requires an insurer to abide by misleading or incorrect statements that are made by one of its\n   agents, even if it can demonstrate that the governing policy form contradicts the agent.\n \uf0a7 Under certain circumstances, this legal principle prevents the insurer from escaping the consequences\n   of its agent\u2019s actions as long as they were within the scope of the agent\u2019s authority.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f    \uf0a7 Estoppel applies when ALL of the following elements are present:\n       \u2012 An agent is acting within her authority.\n       \u2012 The agent makes an inaccurate representation on behalf of the insurance company.\n       \u2012 A consumer relies on the information being correct.\n       \u2012 When a circumstance arises that tests the validity of the questionable representation, the\n           insurance company refuses to honor the agent\u2019s words.\n       \u2012 The insurer\u2019s decision causes financial harm to the consumer.\n\nThe Law of Agency\n    \uf0a7 Insurers grant agents the authority to sell, solicit, and negotiate contracts of insurance, and bind them\n      on their behalf.\n    \uf0a7 When acting within the scope of their authority granted, an act of the agents is an act of the principal.\n    \uf0a7 The relationship between an agent and the company represented is governed by agency law.\n\n  Principles of Agency Law\n    \uf0a7 The four essential principles of agency law include:\n       1. Acts of an agent are equal to the acts of the principal.\n       2. Under law, a contract that\u2019s completed by an agent is also completed by the principal.\n       3. Payments that are received by an agent for the principal are received by the principal.\n       4. If an agent knows it, it\u2019s presumed that the insurance company does as well.\n\n  Agent Authority\n    \uf0a7 \u201cAuthority\u201d is what an insurer grants a licensee to transact insurance on its behalf.\n    \uf0a7 In reality, an agent\u2019s authority can be quite broad.\n\n  Express Authority Express authority is the agent\u2019s authority which is expressly granted in his agency\n  contract.\n    \uf0a7 The principal deliberately gives this authority to one or more agents.\n    \uf0a7 For example, an agent has the express authority to bind coverage for applicants on behalf of the\n      company.\n\n  Implied Authority Implied authority describes the authority we assume an agent needs to transact the\n  principal\u2019s business as expressed in the contract.\n    \uf0a7 Implied authority is incidental to express authority.\n    \uf0a7 Implied authority encompasses the little things an agent needs to do to accomplish the tasks expressly\n      assigned to him under the terms of his agent contract.\n\n  Apparent Authority Apparent authority is the appearance of authority regardless of whether it\n  actually exists.\n    \uf0a7 Apparent authority relies on the perception of an agent\u2019s authority based on the actions, words, or\n      deeds of the principal.\n\n          Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  Brokers versus Agents\n   \uf0a7 Insurance producers may be agents or brokers.\n   \uf0a7 An agent has an agent\u2019s contract, while a broker has a broker\u2019s contract.\n   \uf0a7 In a sales transaction, agents represent the insurer, but brokers represent the buyer (or applicant).\n   \uf0a7 A broker cannot bind coverage; however, an agent can.\n\n  Agent versus Solicitor Authority\n   \uf0a7 Some states license solicitors.\n   \uf0a7 Solicitors have the authority to seek out insurance applicants for a company, but don\u2019t have any\n     authority to bind coverage on behalf of a company.\n   \uf0a7 Solicitors arrange for prospective clients to meet with an agent.\n   \uf0a7 Agents are authorized to handle all of the necessary steps of an insurance sale, from solicitation to\n     sales to taking and binding an application.\n\n  Agent as a Fiduciary\n   \uf0a7 An agent is a fiduciary because an agent holds a position of financial trust and confidence as it relates\n     to both consumers and insurers.\n\nOther Legal Concepts Related to Insurance\n  Subrogation\n   \uf0a7 Subrogation is the insurer\u2019s right to pursue liable third parties for amounts that are paid out in claims\n     which are made by the insured.\n\n  Tort Law\n   \uf0a7 A tort is a wrong against an individual as opposed to a crime, which is a wrong against society.\n   \uf0a7 Torts are adjudicated in civil court, rather than a criminal court.\n   \uf0a7 Civil courts also judge cases involving contracts, which fall under contract law.\n   \uf0a7 Torts most often occur when one individual wrongs another individual by failing to act in a reasonable\n     or prudent manner. This is referred to as negligence.\n   \uf0a7 There are several types of negligence, including:\n       \u2012 Simple negligence is a failure to act (or not act) in a reasonable or prudent manner.\n       \u2012 Gross negligence results from a reckless disregard for the need to act reasonably.\n       \u2012 Willful and wanton negligence combines a reckless disregard for reasonable standards of care\n           and an awareness that harm will probably occur.\n\n  Errors and Omissions (E&O) Insurance\n   \uf0a7 Insurance agents need errors and omissions (E&O) liability insurance, which covers injuries resulting\n     from an error that\u2019s made in rendering or failing to render professional services.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 .

      "content": "General Concepts of Life Insurance\n Types of Life Insurance Policies\n Industrial life insurance issues small face amounts, such as $1,000 or $2,000. Premiums are paid weekly\n and collected by debit agents. They were designed for burial coverage.\n\n Group life insurance is written for members of a group, such as a place of employment, association, or a\n union. Coverage is provided to the members of that group under one master contract. The group is\n underwritten as a whole, not on each member. Typically, group life insurance doesn\u2019t require evidence of\n insurability and is cheaper than individual life insurance.\n\n Ordinary life comprises several types of individual life insurance, such as temporary (term) and\n permanent (whole).\n\n Term life insurance gives a person the most considerable amount of coverage for a limited period. Term\n insurance is only in effect for a limited period because it has a TERMination date. Term insurance is an\n inexpensive type of insurance, which makes it an attractive option for policies with a significant face\n value. Term life is the CHEAPEST type of pure life insurance due to the fact that it has a termination date\n and doesn\u2019t have any cash value. Term life insurance will ALWAYS be cheaper than a whole life policy\n with the same face value. It provides pure death protection since it only pays a death benefit if the insured\n dies during the policy term.\n\n Level term insurance, also referred to as level premium level term, requires a fixed, low premium in\n exchange for level protection that lasts a specified period. For example, if a person needs life insurance\n that provides coverage for the remainder of her working years and wants to pay as little as possible, she\n will need Level term.\n\n Level term life insurance is often renewal and convertible. For example, a person has a 10-year renewable\n and convertible term policy. At the conclusion of the 10 years, the policy terminates, or she can renew it. If\n she renews it, the premium price will go up, and she will have the policy for another 10 years. This cycle\n can continue until she\u2019s too old to renew it or it\u2019s too expensive. All TERM insurance has a final\n TERMINATION date after which it can no longer be renewed. If the policy is CONVERTIBLE, a person\n can CONVERT it to whole life (think, rent to own) at any time. Whenever a person renews or converts\n ANY insurance, she doesn\u2019t need to worry about her health (i.e., her insurability is locked in). However,\n the price will always rise because her current (attained) age is used for your new policy. Term life\n insurance is typically thought of as \u201crenting.\u201d The concept is that a person has a roof over her head, but the\n price of renting is going to rise until it no longer makes sense to continue renting or, at some point, the\n rental contract is TERMINATED, and she gets kicked out.\n\n Premiums are initially higher for non-renewable level term insurance than renewable term life insurance\n because they\u2019re level throughout the policy period. However, with renewable term insurance, the\n premiums will increase at each renewal and eventually exceed those of standard level term insurance.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fDecreasing term life insurance provides an annually decreasing face amount over time with level\npremiums. A decreasing term policy is a type of life policy with a death benefit that adjusts periodically\n(according to a schedule) and is written for a specific period. Decreasing term policies are generally\nwritten for the protection of a mortgage or other debt that typically decreases over time until it\u2019s paid\noff. For example, a 15-year decreasing term policy could protect a 15-year mortgage. As the mortgage\nbalance reduces each year, the face value of the insurance policy will adjust accordingly to match. After\nthe mortgage is paid off, the insurance policy will expire.\n\nCredit policies are typically purchased using a decreasing term life insurance policy, with a term that\u2019s\nmatched to the length of the loan period and the decreasing insurance amount matched to the declining\nloan balance. Since credit life insurance is designed to cover the life of a debtor and pay the amount\ndue on a loan if the debtor dies before the loan is repaid, credit policies can only be purchased for up to\nthe amount of the debt or loan outstanding. For example, if a person wants an insurance policy to protect a\n$20,000, five-year auto loan, he could use a five-year decreasing term life insurance policy with an initial\nface value of $20,000. He will pay the same level premium every month for the five-year term of the\npolicy. The face value will start at $20,000 and change according to a schedule (the auto loan). After five\nyears, the car will be paid off, and the insurance policy will no longer be needed.\n\nIncreasing term life insurance provides an increasing face amount over time based on specific amounts\nor a percentage of the original face amount.\n\nConvertible term life insurance policies have a provision that allows the policyowner to convert the\nterm insurance into a permanent insurance policy without proof of insurability. For example, John\ntook out a low-cost term life insurance policy when he was young to take advantage of his excellent\nhealth. Knowing that the policy would eventually terminate, John wanted the option to convert the policy\nto a permanent one for final expense benefits when his finances improve. The conversion privilege of a\ngroup term life policy allows an individual to leave the group term (temporary) plan and convert his\ninsurance to an individual (permanent) policy without providing evidence of insurability.\n\nTerm life insurance policies are typically converted using the insured\u2019s attained (current) age, not the age\nof the insured at the time of the original application. The insured\u2019s age is a primary factor for calculating\npremium costs. Therefore, using the insured\u2019s current (attained) age will result in higher premiums than\nusing the insured\u2019s original age. For example, a $25,000 policy on a healthy seven-year-old boy will cost\nsubstantially less than a $25,000 policy on a 57-year-old man.\n\nWhether converting an individual or group term insurance policy, the insured\u2019s insurability is guaranteed.\nHowever, the cost of the policy will be based on her current (attained) age, not the age when she applied\nfor the original term policy. Convertible term insurance allows the insured to enroll in temporary coverage\nand later change it to permanent coverage without insurability (good health). However, the premiums will\nincrease due to using the insured\u2019s attained age.\n\nRenewable term insurance guarantees the insured the right to continue term coverage after the expiration\nof the initial policy period without proving insurability. When a term policy is renewed, the insured is\nnot required to prove insurability. However, the premium price will rise because the insurance company\nwill use the insured\u2019s current or attained age to determine the new premiums. If a customer wants\ncoverage at the lowest possible cost that was good for a limited period but offers the ability to continue the\ncoverage after the expiration, the customer will want a renewable term policy.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fAnnual renewable term coverage provides a level face amount that renews annually. This type of\ncoverage is guaranteed renewable annually without proof of insurability.\n\nWhole life insurance provides a permanent death benefit for the entire life of the insured, but it also\nprovides living benefits in the form of cash values and policy loans. Whole life insurance typically has a\nlevel premium and matures once the insured attains the age of 100.\n\nAdvantages of whole life insurance:\n  \uf0a7 Covers the entire life of the insured\n  \uf0a7 Living benefits \u2013 cash value and policy loans\n  \uf0a7 Fixed premiums\n\nDrawbacks of whole life insurance:\n  \uf0a7 Protection is more expensive than term insurance because of the policy\u2019s living benefits\n  \uf0a7 Premium paying period may extend beyond the income-earning years\n\nWhole life is often compared to BUYING (e.g., BUYING a house). The idea is a person can pay off a\nhouse slowly or quickly; however, regardless of how it\u2019s paid, once it\u2019s paid for, the person owns the\nhouse. There are several types of whole life. All whole life policies have the same types of benefits. The\nonly difference in \u201ctypes\u201d of whole life is how the policy is paid. All whole life policies last until death or\nto the age of 100, have a fixed premium, and offer level benefits with cash value accumulation regardless\nof how it is paid.\n\nTypes of whole life insurance include:\n  \uf0a7 Straight life: This is basic whole life insurance with a level face amount and fixed premiums that are\n    payable over the insured\u2019s entire life, or to the age of 100 (maturity of policy).\n  \uf0a7 Limited Pay Whole life: This is whole life insurance in which the insured is covered for her entire\n    life, but premiums are paid for a limited time. As the premium payment period shortens, the total cost\n    for the insured decreases, and the policy\u2019s cash values increase faster. For example, under a life paid-\n    up at age 65 policy, premiums are only paid until the insured is 65 years old. With a 20-pay life\n    policy, the insured only pays for 20 years. All policy provisions and insurability being equal, a 40-\n    year-old insured would pay more for the 20-pay life than she would for a paid-up at age 65 policy.\n    Additionally, her cash value would accumulate at a faster rate. Both of these policies are in effect until\n    the insured\u2019s death or until she reaches the age of 100.\n  \uf0a7 Single premium whole life: Allows the insured to pay the entire premium in one lump-sum and have\n    coverage for her entire life.\n       \u2012 An immediate non-forfeiture value is created\n       \u2012 Immediate cash value is created\n       \u2012 A large part of the premium is used to set up the policy\u2019s reserve\n  \uf0a7 Modified whole life: This type has low premiums in the early years and jumps to a higher premium in\n    the later years but remains fixed after that. Premiums increase just once.\n  \uf0a7 Graded whole life: Under a typical graded premium life insurance policy, the premium increases yearly\n    for a stated number of years, then remains level. Premiums continue to stay level for the remainder of\n    the policy. For example, a policy can start low in a graded whole life insurance policy and increase a\n    small amount every year up until the fifth year, then it will level off for the remainder of the policy.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fSpecial Use Policies\nIn addition to the basic types of life insurance policies, there are a number of \u201cspecial use\u201d policies\ninsurance companies offer. Many of these are a combination (or package) of different policy types and are\ndesigned to serve a variety of needs.\n\nFamily plan policies are designed to insure all family members under one policy. Usually, the family\nhead is covered by permanent (whole life) insurance, and the spouse/children are included on the same\npolicy as level term life riders (family term riders).\n\nThe term coverage on the spouse and children is typically convertible to permanent coverage without\nevidence of insurability as long as it\u2019s \u201cattached\u201d to another person\u2019s policy. Think sidecar on a\nmotorcycle. Riders must RIDE on something.\n\nFamily plan policy example:\n  \uf0a7 Husband \u2013 Whole Life Policy\n  \uf0a7 Wife (spouse) \u2013 Term Policy which is convertible without proof of insurability\n  \uf0a7 Children \u2013 Term Policies which are convertible (typically at the age of 18 or 21) without proof of\n    insurability; premium remains the same regardless of the number of children\n\nFamily income policies combine whole life insurance and decreasing term insurance. It provides monthly\nincome to a beneficiary if death occurs during a specified period after the date of purchase. If the insured\ndies after the specified period, only the face value is paid to the beneficiary since the decreasing term\ninsurance expired. Income needs typically DECREASE over time because the household debt shrinks.\n\nFamily maintenance policies combine whole life insurance and level term. They provide income to a\nbeneficiary for a selected period if an insured dies during that period. At the end of the income-paying\nperiod, the beneficiary also receives the entire face amount of the policy. If an insured dies after the end of\nthe selected period, the beneficiary receives only the face value of the whole life policy. Maintenance\n\u201cmaintains\u201d the family using level term insurance. This means that the family will receive a benefit for a\npreset number of years after the insured\u2019s death.\n\nMultiple protection policies pay a benefit of double or triple the face amount if death occurs during a\nspecified period. If death occurs after the period has expired, only the policy face amount is paid. The\nperiod may be for a specified number of years (e.g., 10, 15, or 20 years) or to a specified age (e.g., the age\nof 65). These policies are combinations of permanent insurance and level term insurance.\n\nJoint life policies cover two or more people. The age of the insureds is averaged, and a single premium is\ncharged. It uses permanent insurance (as opposed to term) and pays a death benefit when one of the\ninsureds dies. The survivors then have the option of purchasing an individual policy without evidence of\ninsurability. The premium for a joint life policy is less than the premium for separate, multiple policies.\nONE policy covers two. This is similar to a \u201cjoint account\u201d with a bank \u2013 one account (or policy, in this\ncase) for two people.\n\nA variation of the joint life policy is the joint and survivor policy, or a \u201csurvivorship life policy\u201d (it can\nalso be referred to as a \u201csecond to die\u201d policy). This plan also covers two lives, but the benefit is paid upon\nthe death of the last surviving insured. Compared to the combined premium for separate life insurance\npolicies on two individuals, the premium for a survivorship life policy is lower.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fJuvenile Insurance is life insurance written on the life of a minor. The adult applicant is typically the\npremium payor until the child comes of age and can take over the payments.\n\nCredit life insurance is designed to cover the life of a debtor and pay the amount due on a loan if the\ndebtor dies before the loan is repaid. It\u2019s issued in an amount that\u2019s not to exceed the outstanding loan\nbalance and is generally paid entirely by the borrower. A decreasing term policy is most often used.\n\nNon-Traditional Life Policies\nInterest-Sensitive Whole Life: Interest-sensitive life insurance (current assumption whole life insurance)\nis a type of whole life insurance in which the cash value can increase beyond the stated guarantee if\neconomic conditions warrant. It also allows the insured to increase the face amount or use the extra cash\nvalue to lower future premiums. Premiums can vary to reflect the insurer\u2019s changing assumptions\nconcerning its death, investment, and expense factors. CAWL (current assumption whole life) policies are\nalmost always an MEC due to accelerated premiums.\n\nAdjustable life policies are distinguished by their flexibility from combining term and whole life\ninsurance into a single plan. The policyowner determines how much protection is needed and how much\npremium he\u2019s willing to pay. Adjustable life insurance allows a person to vary his coverage as his needs\nchange without requiring evidence of insurability. Consequently, no new policy needs to be issued when\nchanges are desired. Adjustable life has all the usual features of whole life insurance.\n\nUniversal life is a variation of whole life insurance and is characterized by considerable flexibility.\nChanges may be made with relative ease by the policyowner with these flexible-premium policies.\nInvestment gains go toward the cash value. Unlike whole life (with its fixed premiums, fixed face\namounts, and fixed cash value accumulations), universal life allows its policyowners to determine the\namount and frequency of premium payments, which will adjust the policy face amount. Essential\ncharacteristics of a universal life policy are flexible premiums, flexible benefits, no minimum death\nbenefit, and cash value withdrawals. Cash value accumulations are subject to a minimum interest\nguarantee. Any surrender charges of a universal policy must be disclosed.\n\nEquity Index Universal Life insurance (EIUL) is a permanent life insurance policy that allows\npolicyholders to tie accumulation values to a stock market index, such as the S&P 500. Indexed universal\nlife insurance policies typically contain a minimum guaranteed fixed interest rate component and the\nindexed account option. Indexed policies give policyholders the security of fixed universal life insurance\nwith the growth potential of a variable policy linked to indexed returns. The potential extra interest is\nbased on the investments of the company\u2019s general account.\n\nModified Endowment Contracts (MECs) are policies that are overfunded, according to IRS tables.\nPolicies that don\u2019t meet the seven-pay test are considered MECs and will lose favorable tax treatment.\nThe seven-pay test is a limitation on the total amount a person can pay into a policy in the first seven years\nof its existence. The test is designed to discourage premium schedules that result in a paid-up policy before\nthe end of a seven-year period.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fFor example, if the yearly premium is $500, over seven years, the total amount paid would equal $3,500. If\na person paid $3,501, the policy has exceeded the 7-pay test and is no longer a life insurance contract.\nInstead, it will be taxed as an investment.\n  \uf0a7 If withdrawn before age 59 1/2, there\u2019s a 10% penalty.\n  \uf0a7 Taxation only occurs when cash is distributed.\n  \uf0a7 Funds that are withdrawn from an MEC are subject to last-in-first-out (LIFO) tax treatment, which\n    assumes that the investment or earnings portion of the contract\u2019s values is withdrawn first (making\n    these funds fully taxable as ordinary income).\n  \uf0a7 Penalties and taxes may be assessed on premature distributions (i.e., policy loans) from a modified\n    endowment contract (MEC).\n\nVariable Insurance Products\nDue to the transfer of investment risk from the insurer to the policyowner, variable insurance products are\nconsidered both securities contracts and insurance contracts. A producer is required to register with the\nNational Association of Securities Dealers to sell variable products.\n\nVariable whole life insurance was created to help offset the effects of inflation on death benefits.\nVariable whole life insurance is permanent life insurance with many of the characteristics of traditional\nwhole life insurance. The main difference between traditional whole life insurance and variable whole life\ninsurance is how the policy\u2019s cash values are invested. With traditional whole life insurance, these values\nare kept in the insurer\u2019s general accounts and invested in conservative investments that are selected by the\ninsurer to match its contractual guarantees and liabilities. With variable life insurance policies, the policy\nvalues are invested in accounts that are separate from the insurer\u2019s general accounts. These accounts allow\nthe policyowner the option to direct the investment choice and offer common stock, bond, money market,\nand other securities investment options. Values that are held in these separate accounts are invested in\nriskier, but potentially higher-yielding, assets than those held in the general account. The primary\ncharacteristics of a variable life policy include fixed premiums, a guaranteed minimum death benefit\nwhich fluctuates over the minimum, and cash values which fluctuate and are not guaranteed.\n\nVariable universal life (VUL) life insurance combines all the characteristics of universal life and variable\nlife. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in various separate accounts, similar to mutual funds. The\nchoice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The \u2018variable\u2019\ncomponent in the name refers to the ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary because they\u2019re\ninvested in the stock and bond markets. The \u2018universal\u2019 component in the name refers to the flexibility the\nowner has in making premium payments. Variable universal life insurance provides the policyowner with\nflexible premiums, adjustable death benefits, a guaranteed minimum death benefit. It gives the insured\ngrowth potential for higher returns and the potential for loss. Evidence of insurability can be required for an\nindividual who\u2019s covered by a variable universal life policy when the death benefit is increased.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 .

      "content": "Standard Life Insurance Provisions\n Entire Contract:\n  \uf0a7 The entire contract includes the actual policy and the application.\n  \uf0a7 It states that nothing outside of the contract (the contract includes the signed application and any\n    attached policy riders) can be considered part of the contract.\n  \uf0a7 It also assures the policyowner that no changes will be made to the contract or the waiver of any of the\n    provisions after it has been issued, even if the insurer makes policy changes that affect all policy sales\n    in the future. However, this doesn\u2019t prevent a mutually agreeable change or modification of the\n    contract after it has been issued.\n  \uf0a7 Any change to a policy must be made with the approval of an executive officer of the insurance\n    company whose approval must be endorsed on the policy or attached in a rider.\n  \uf0a7 The execution clause states that the insurance contract will be executed when both parties (the insurer\n    and the policyowner) have satisfied the conditions of the contract.\n  \uf0a7 The privilege of change clause (or policy change provision) outlines the conditions under which the\n    company will allow the policyowner to change the policy\u2019s coverage.\n Insuring Clause (or Insuring Agreement):\n  \uf0a7 The insuring clause is the insurer\u2019s basic promise to pay specified benefits to a designated person in\n    the event of a covered loss.\n  \uf0a7 This is the part of the insurance policy that identifies the specific type of benefits or services that are\n    covered by the policy and the circumstances under which they will be paid.\n  \uf0a7 The purpose of this clause in an insurance policy is to specify the scope and limits of the coverage\n    provided.\n  \uf0a7 Any promises that the INSURER makes will be in the INSURING clause.\n Consideration Clause:\n  \uf0a7 A policyowner must pay a premium in exchange for the insurer\u2019s promise to pay benefits.\n  \uf0a7 A policyowner\u2019s consideration consists of completing the application and paying the initial premium.\n  \uf0a7 The amount and frequency of premium payments are contained in the consideration clause. For\n    insurance, the insurance company exchanges the promises in the policy for a two-part consideration\n    from the insured.\n  \uf0a7 Consideration is an exchange of an item of value on which a contract is based.\n  \uf0a7 An insurance contract is valid only if the insured provides consideration in the form of the initial full\n    minimum premium required and the statements that are made in the application.\n  \uf0a7 The applicant states, \u201cPlease CONSIDER me for insurance. Here is my completed application, my\n    initial premium, as well as how much money and how often I agree to pay. Please CONSIDER me!\u201d\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fIncontestable Clause:\n \uf0a7 In a life insurance contract, this is the clause that prohibits the insurer from questioning the validity of\n   the contract after a certain period has elapsed.\n \uf0a7 The period is typically two years from the policy\u2019s issue date. Since state requirements may be\n   different, they will be covered in the state law portion at the end of the course.\nPhysical Exam and Autopsy:\n \uf0a7 The physical exam and autopsy provision entitles a company, at its own expense, to make physical\n   examinations of the insured at reasonable intervals during the period of a claim, unless it\u2019s forbidden\n   by state law.\n \uf0a7 Only the state can forbid an autopsy. A person (and her family) gives up her right to refuse when she\n   applies for insurance.\nMisstatement of Age or Sex:\n \uf0a7 Allows the insurer to adjust the policy benefits if the insured\u2019s age or sex is misstated on the policy\n   application.\n \uf0a7 The misstatement of age provision allows the insurer to adjust the benefit payable if the age of the\n   insured was misstated when the application for the policy was made.\n \uf0a7 The insurer can adjust the benefit to what the premiums paid would have purchased at the insured\u2019s\n   actual age.\n \uf0a7 At the time of application, if the insured were older than what\u2019s shown in the application, benefits\n   would be reduced accordingly. The benefits would be increased if the insured were younger than\n   what\u2019s listed in the application.\nOwner\u2019s Rights Provision\n \uf0a7 Defines the person who may name and change beneficiaries, select options available under the policy,\n   and receive any financial benefits from the policy.\nAssignment Provision\n \uf0a7 The assignment clause or provision is the right to transfer policy rights to another person or entity.\n   The new owner is referred to as the assignee.\n \uf0a7 An absolute assignment occurs when the assignee receives full control of the policy and the rights to\n   the policy benefits from the current policyowner. Under an absolute assignment, the transfer is\n   complete and irrevocable, and the assignee receives full control over the policy and full rights to its\n   benefits.\n \uf0a7 A collateral assignment is the partial and temporary transfer of rights to another person or entity.\n   Collateral assignments are typically intended for securing a loan with a creditor. A collateral\n   assignment occurs when the policy is assigned to a creditor as security or collateral for a debt. If the\n   insured dies (or possibly becomes totally\\permanently disabled), the creditor is entitled to be\n   reimbursed out of the benefit proceeds for the amount owed. The insured\u2019s beneficiary is then entitled\n   to any excess of policy proceeds over the amount due to the creditor.\nFree Look:\n \uf0a7 Once the policy is delivered, the policyowner is permitted a certain number of days to look over the\n   policy and, if dissatisfied, return it for a refund of all premiums paid.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fGrace Period:\n \uf0a7 The grace period is a specified period after a premium payment is due, during which the protection of\n   the policy continues despite the fact that the payment for the renewal premium has not yet been\n   received.\n \uf0a7 The policyowner is given a number of days after the premium due date and, during this time, the\n   premium payment may be delayed without penalty, and the policy continues in force.\n \uf0a7 If the insured dies during the grace period of a life insurance policy before paying the required annual\n   premium, the beneficiary will receive the face amount of the policy less any required premiums.\n \uf0a7 The purpose of the grace period is to give the policyowner additional time to pay overdue premiums.\nReinstatement:\n \uf0a7 The reinstatement provision allows the policyowner to reinstate a policy that has lapsed as long as the\n   policyowner can provide proof of insurability and pays all back premiums, outstanding loans, and\n   interest.\n \uf0a7 Most states allow reinstatement for up to three years after a policy has lapsed. However, for some\n   states the reinstatements are from five to seven years.\n \uf0a7 This provision specifies that if an insured fails to pay a renewal premium within the time granted, but\n   the insurer subsequently accepts the premium, coverage may be restored.\n \uf0a7 Under certain conditions, a policy that has lapsed may be reinstated.\n \uf0a7 Reinstatement is automatic if the company or its authorized agent accepts the delinquent premium,\n   and the company doesn\u2019t require an application for reinstatement. If it takes no action on the\n   application for 45 days, the policy is reinstated automatically.\n \uf0a7 To reinstate any policy, a person needs a reinstatement application, statement of good health, and\n   payment of all back premiums.\n\nProvisions and Options Related to Cash Value\nNon-Forfeiture Options\n \uf0a7 When a policyowner decides he doesn\u2019t want his life insurance policy any longer, he has the option to\n   surrender his policy. If there\u2019s cash value remaining, the policyowner must use one of the following\n   non-forfeiture options:\n      \u2012 Cash Surrender: Allows the policyowner to receive the policy\u2019s cash value and, at this point,\n           the policyowner no longer has coverage. Typically, the maximum length of time a life insurance\n           company may legally defer paying the cash value of a surrendered policy is six months (delayed\n           payment provision).\n      \u2012 Extended Term Option: Permits the policyowner to use the policy\u2019s cash value to buy level,\n           extended term insurance for a specified period. No premium payments are made. The coverage\n           provided with the extended term non-forfeiture option is equal to the net death benefit of the\n           lapsed policy.\n      \u2012 Reduced Paid-Up Option: The policyowner pays no more premiums, but the face amount is\n           decreased.\n \uf0a7 If the insured is closing her account (surrendering her policy), the insurance company is questioning\n   what it should do with her cash (so that she doesn\u2019t forfeit it).\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fPolicy Loan Provisions:\n \uf0a7 Policies that have cash value also have policy loan and withdrawal provisions. These policies must\n   begin to build cash value after a certain number of years. In most states, the period is three years.\n \uf0a7 Policy loans (with interest) cannot exceed the guaranteed cash value, if so, the policy is no longer in\n   force.\n \uf0a7 The policyowner has the right to the policy\u2019s cash value.\n \uf0a7 Policy loans are not taxable.\n \uf0a7 At time of the insured\u2019s death, any loans (with interest due) will be deducted from the insured\u2019s policy\n   proceeds.\nAutomatic Premium Loans:\n \uf0a7 This provision allows the insurer to automatically use the policy cash value to pay an overdue\n   premium. Therefore, it allows the insurance company to deduct the overdue premium from an\n   insured\u2019s cash value by the end of the grace period if a payment is missed on a life policy.\n \uf0a7 There\u2019s no cost associated with this provision.\n \uf0a7 The automatic premium loans provision is similar to using a savings account for overdraft protection,\n   but there\u2019s no fee. Instead, there\u2019s simply interest charged for borrowing the funds. If the loan is not\n   repaid, interest is added to the loan.\n \uf0a7 Outstanding loans are subtracted from any death benefit or cash surrenders if they\u2019re not paid back\n   first.\n \uf0a7 The insurance company can AUTOMATICALLY take out a LOAN for the insured against his CASH\n   VALUE to cover his PREMIUM in the event the company doesn\u2019t\u2019 receive his payment.\n \uf0a7 Automatic premium loans can continue for as long as the insurer doesn\u2019t receive payment and the\n   policyowner has cash value remaining in the policy. Once all of the cash value is gone, if the\n   policyowner doesn\u2019t start paying, the policy will lapse.\n \uf0a7 The automatic premium loans function in the same manner as any other cash value loan.\n\nProvisions and Options Related to Policy Proceeds\nBeneficiary Designation:\n \uf0a7 This is where the policyowner indicates who\u2019s to receive the proceeds.\nChange of Beneficiary:\n \uf0a7 The policyowner may change the beneficiary designation at any time unless a beneficiary has been\n   identified as irrevocable.\nSettlement Options:\n \uf0a7 The methods by which the policy proceeds can be paid out or settled.\n \uf0a7 Typically, the beneficiary chooses the settlement option at the time of the insured\u2019s death.\n \uf0a7 The spendthrift clause stipulates that the policyowner may select a settlement option at the time of\n   application.\nAccelerated Benefits Rider:\n \uf0a7 This rider allows the insured to receive a portion of the death benefit prior to death if the insured has a\n   terminal illness and is expected to die within one to two years. Regardless of the amount withdrawn in\n   an accelerated death benefit, it will decrease the death benefit when death occurs.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f \uf0a7 For example, an insurance company may know that a person is going to die soon, which means it\u2019s\n   going to be paying out the benefit soon. To make things a little easier and less stressful, the company\n   will give the insured some of the proceeds NOW and deduct from what would go to the beneficiary\n   upon the insured\u2019s death.\nLong-Term Care Rider:\n \uf0a7 A long-term care rider is a type of accelerated benefits rider that will pay a benefit if the insured is\n   permanently confined to a nursing home and requires long-term care or is unable to perform two or\n   more activities of daily living.\n \uf0a7 Activities of daily living (ADLs) include eating, dressing, bathing, toileting/continence,\n   walking/ambulation, transferring, or taking medication.\n\nProvisions and Options Related to Policy Dividends\nDividends:\n \uf0a7 Participating policies pay dividends to policyowners if the company\u2019s operations result in a divisible\n   surplus.\n \uf0a7 Dividends are a return of overcharged premiums and are therefore not taxable.\n \uf0a7 Insurers typically pay dividends on an annual basis.\nDividend Options:\n \uf0a7 The following dividend options are available to policyowners for settling dividend payments:\n    \u2012 Cash Option: The insured simply takes the cash.\n    \u2012 Reduced Premiums Option: Reduces premium payments by having the insurance company\n         retain the money and charge less the following year.\n    \u2012 Accumulate Interest Option: Allows dividends to accumulate interest. Interest is the only part\n         of a potential dividend for which the policyowner may be taxed.\n    \u2012 Paid-Up Additions Option: Purchases single payment whole life coverage.\n    \u2012 One-Year Term Option: Purchase one-year term protection.\n \uf0a7 Unlike non-forfeiture options, the policy remains active when a dividend option is selected.\n\nLife Insurance Policy Riders\nWaiver of Premium Rider:\n \uf0a7 This rider allows the policyowner to waive premium payments during a disability and keeps the policy\n   in force; it doesn\u2019t provide cash payments to the policyowner.\n \uf0a7 The disability must be total and permanent and must have sustained through the waiting period (either\n   90 days or six months).\n \uf0a7 After a certain age (typically the age of 60 or 65), the waiver of premium rider is void, unless it\u2019s\n   currently in use.\n \uf0a7 The waiver of premium covers the PRIMARY INSURED, not any additional insureds.\n \uf0a7 This provision does NOT provide income and is NOT a loan. Instead, the insurance company is\n   \u201cwaiving\u201d the premiums\u201d and treating it as if the insured made the premium payments each month.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fAccidental Death Benefit Rider (Double Indemnity):\n \uf0a7 This rider may be added to a permanent or temporary life insurance policy.\n \uf0a7 It pays an additional sum to the beneficiary if the insured dies due to an accident.\n \uf0a7 The amount paid is a multiple of the policy face amount, such as double or triple the original benefit.\n   This is truly the cheapest way to add a large amount of coverage for a specific period.\n \uf0a7 Provides an additional amount of insurance that\u2019s typically equal to the face amount of the base policy\n   if the cause of death was the result of an accident.\nAccidental Death and Dismemberment Rider:\n \uf0a7 This rider may be added to a permanent or temporary life insurance policy, and it pays benefits for\n   dismemberment and accidental death.\n \uf0a7 It pays a principal sum (face amount) for loss of both hands, both arms, both legs, or loss of vision in\n   both eyes.\n \uf0a7 Pays capital sum (half of face value) for loss of one foot, one hand, one eye, etc.\n \uf0a7 One foot and one hand = 100% face value.\nGuaranteed Insurability Option Rider:\n \uf0a7 This rider allows a policyowner to purchase additional life insurance coverage at specified dates\n   without providing evidence of insurability.\n \uf0a7 It also includes specific events (e.g., marriage or birth of a child) without requiring the proof of\n   insurability.\n \uf0a7 The benefit is typically allowed every three years, up to the original face amount of the policy.\n \uf0a7 This feature is also referred to as the future increase option.\nCost of Living Rider:\n \uf0a7 This rider allows the policy face amount to be adjusted to account for inflation based on the Consumer\n   Price Index (CPI).\nPayor Provision (Rider):\n \uf0a7 The payor provision is typically attached to juvenile policies to protects the insured in the event that\n   the PAYOR dies or is disabled.\n \uf0a7 With this provision, if the adult premium payor of the juvenile policy dies or becomes disabled, the\n   premiums will be waived until the child reaches a specified age (e.g., age 18, 21, or 25).\n \uf0a7 This provision is also referred to as the payor clause.\nTerm Rider:\n \uf0a7 A term rider allows an applicant to have excess coverage by adding an additional term rider to her\n   primary policy.\n \uf0a7 A term rider is an economical way to add a large amount of additional insurance to a permanent life\n   insurance policy.\n \uf0a7 Term riders covering the life of the insured can be level, increasing, or decreasing term.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fReturn of Premium Rider:\n \uf0a7 This rider returns the total amount of premiums paid into the policy, in addition to the face value, as\n   long as the insured dies within a specific period that\u2019s specified in the policy.\n \uf0a7 It also returns premiums to the living insured at the end of a specified period as long as the premiums\n   have been paid.\nOther Insureds Provisions:\n \uf0a7 Other insured or dependent riders may be added to a primary policy to cover a spouse or \u201canother\n   insured,\u201d children, or adopted children.\n \uf0a7 Family plan policies typically cover the family head with permanent insurance, and the coverage on\n   the spouse and children is term insurance in the form of a rider.\n \uf0a7 A term rider for other insureds is always level term.\n \uf0a7 Adding a term rider is cheaper than having every family member obtain their own policy.\n     \u2012 For example, the primary policy may be on a father, but the mother and the children are riding\n         on (attached to) the father\u2019s policy as term riders. Term riders allow for additional family\n         members to be covered under one policy by attaching everyone to the primary policy.\nChild Term Rider:\n \uf0a7 A child term rider is a life insurance product that rides on the primary parent\u2019s policy and covers the\n   lives of the children.\n \uf0a7 The child term rider is typically one flat premium, regardless of the number of children covered.\n \uf0a7 Remember, a child term rider pays a benefit to the beneficiary (parent) if the child dies; it doesn\u2019t pay\n   the child.\nSpousal Term Rider:\n \uf0a7 A spousal term rider is a life insurance product that rides on the primary policy and covers the life of\n   the primary insured\u2019s spouse.\n \uf0a7 Remember, a spouse term rider pays a benefit to the beneficiary (primary insured) if the spouse dies; it\n   doesn\u2019t pay the spouse.\n\nCommon Exclusions or Restrictions\nExclusions:\n \uf0a7 An exclusion is a feature of a life insurance policy stating that the policy will not cover certain risks.\n \uf0a7 Exclusions and restrictions are situations or conditions which are not covered or are covered with\n   substantial limits.\n \uf0a7 The exclusions section is NOT included in the policy face (i.e., the first page of an insurance policy).\nWar or Military Service\n \uf0a7 The insurer will not pay the claim if the insured dies or is injured while in active military service or\n   due to an act of war.\nAviation\n \uf0a7 The insurer will not pay the claim if the insured dies due to involvement with aviation. Typically, this\n   is limited to high-risk aviation (e.g., stunt pilot, instructor/student pilot, or a military pilot).\n \uf0a7 Although uncommon, it may also exclude the period during which insured is serving as a pilot or crew\n   member of an aircraft.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fHazardous Occupation or Hobby\n \uf0a7 If the insured dies as a result of a hazardous occupation or hobby, the insurer will not pay the claim.\n \uf0a7 To deny the claim, the activity or occupation for which the claim is being denied must be explicitly\n   excluded in the policy (i.e., part of the entire contract).\n \uf0a7 The change of occupation provision allows the insurer to reduce the maximum benefit payable under\n   the policy if the insured switches to a more hazardous occupation or reduce the premium rate charged\n   if the insured changes to a less hazardous occupation.\nCriminal Activity\n \uf0a7 Losses due to injuries that are sustained while rioting, committing a felony, or attempting to do so,\n   also may be excluded.\n     \u2012 Illegal Occupation: This provision specifies that the insurer is not liable for losses that are\n         attributed to the insured\u2019s being connected with a felony or participating in an illegal occupation.\n     \u2012 Intoxicants and Narcotics: The insurer is not liable for any loss that\u2019s attributed to the insured\n         while intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics.\nSuicide Clause:\n \uf0a7 The policy will be voided and therefore no death benefit will be paid if the insured commits suicide\n   within one to two years from policy issuance. The primary purpose of a suicide provision is to protect\n   the insurer against the purchase of a policy by a person who\u2019s contemplating suicide.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 .

      "content": "PROCEEDS, AND BENEFICIARIES\n Purpose of Premiums\n  \uf0a7 The insurer receives a premium from a policyowner in exchange for insurance protection. The\n    premium is part of the policyowner\u2019s consideration or the \u201cbinding force\u201d in the contract, which\n    cements the agreement between the insurer and policyowner.\n\n Factors in Premium Calculation\n  \uf0a7 Mortality Factor: A measure of the number of deaths in a given population. Mortality is based on a\n    large risk pool of people and time. Insurance companies use mortality tables to help predict the life\n    expectancy and probability of death for a given group.\n  \uf0a7 Interest Factor: Insurance companies invest the premiums they receive in an effort to earn interest.\n    The rate of earnings on investments is one of the ways that an insurance company can reduce\n    premium rates.\n  \uf0a7 Expense Factor: As any other business, insurance companies have operating expenses that need to\n    be factored into the premiums being charged. The expense factor is also referred to as the loading\n    charge.\n\n Other Factors That Impact the Premium Amount\n  \uf0a7 Age: The older the person, the higher probability of death and disability.\n  \uf0a7 Sex/Gender: Women tend to live longer than men; therefore, their premiums are generally lower.\n  \uf0a7 Health: Poor health increases the probability of death and disability.\n  \uf0a7 Occupation: A hazardous job increases the risk of loss.\n  \uf0a7 Hobbies: High-risk hobbies also increase the risk of loss. Remember, these are typically only\n    important at the time of application. For example, a person is obtaining life insurance and states that\n    he\u2019s never been skydiving (which is true). Then, five years later, the person goes skydiving for the\n    first time and dies in an accident. In this case, the insurance company will pay the death benefit.\n  \uf0a7 Habits: Tobacco use presents a higher risk than for non-smokers.\n  \uf0a7 Benefits, options, and riders: The number and types of benefits provided by a policy affect the\n    premium rate. The greater the benefits, the higher the premium. Or, put another way, the greater the\n    risk to the company, the higher the premium.\n  \uf0a7 Premium mode refers to the premium payment schedule and permits the policyowner to select the\n    timing of premium payments. Options include annual, semiannual, quarterly, and monthly. The\n    more frequently the payments are made, the more it\u2019s going to cost overall. Ideally, if a person is able\n    to make one payment in a lump-sum to start and \u201cpay up\u201d the policy, she will save the most money.\n    Also, her cash value will begin to accumulate immediately. The higher the premium payments, the\n    quicker the cash value will accumulate. The higher the frequency of payments, the higher the total\n    premiums.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fPremium Terms and Funding\n \uf0a7 An insurance company\u2019s reserves represent money that (together with future premiums, interest, and\n   survivorship benefits) will fulfill an insurance company\u2019s obligations to pay future claims. Each state\n   has its own reserve requirements.\n \uf0a7 The earned premium (the amount of premium to which an insurer is entitled for the insurance\n   coverage provided) and the unearned premium (the premium collected from the policyholder for\n   future coverage) make up the insurer\u2019s total premium.\n \uf0a7 Cost basis represents the premiums paid into the policy minus total dividends received in cash or used\n   to offset premiums.\n \uf0a7 Net premium is a premium that makes provision for mortality (death benefit) losses only while being\n   influenced by the interest rate assumed, gender, the benefit to be provided, and the mortality rate.\n \uf0a7 Gross premium is the premium charged by an insurer and is comprised of or influenced by all factors\n   of mortality, interest, and expenses. It\u2019s the actual premium paid by the policyowner for life insurance\n   coverage. (Gross premium = Net premium + Insurer expenses).\n \uf0a7 Single premium funding: The policyowner pays a single premium that provides protection for life as\n   a paid-up policy. Single premium funding provides for the lowest total premium and fastest build-up\n   of cash value.\n     \u2012 For example, John, a 30-year-old non-smoker, buys a $100,000 whole life policy for one single\n         premium of $70,000.\n \uf0a7 Level (fixed) premium funding: The policyowner pays more in the early years for protection to help\n   cover the cost in later years. This allows the premiums to remain level throughout the life of the\n   policy. The shorter the premium-paying period, the higher the periodic premiums.\n     \u2012 For example, John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for 10 (annual) level premiums\n         of $8,000 each ($80,000 total premiums); or John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy\n         for 840 level premiums (monthly for 70 years) of $105 each ($88,200 total).\n \uf0a7 Modified premium funding is characterized by an initial premium that\u2019s lower than it should be\n   during an introductory period (typically the first three to five years). After this time, the premium will\n   increase to an amount that\u2019s greater than what the initial level premium would have been and then\n   remains level or constant for the life of the policy.\n     \u2012 For example, John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for 36 initial fixed premiums\n         (monthly for three years) of $50 each ($1,800 total introductory) and then an additional 804\n         fixed premiums (monthly for 67 years) of $110 each ($88,440 total remainder). ($1,800\n         introductory + $88,440 for reminder = $90,240 total).\n \uf0a7 Graded premium funding is a contract that\u2019s characterized (like modified) by a lower premium in\n   the early years of the contract. However, premiums increase annually for the initial period. Then, it\n   increases to an amount that\u2019s higher than what the initial level premium would have been, but\n   thereafter remains level or constant for the life of the policy.\n     \u2012 For example, John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for monthly payments of $20 for\n         year 1, monthly payments of $40 for year 2, monthly payments of $50 for year 3, monthly\n         payments of $75 for year 4 ($2,220 total introductory), and then an additional 792 fixed\n         premiums (monthly for 66 years) of $120 each month ($95,040 total remainder). ($2,220\n         introductory + $95,040 for reminder = $97,260 total).\n \uf0a7 Flexible premium funding allows the policyowner to adjust the premiums throughout the life of the\n   contract.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f \uf0a7 Minimum deposit financing allows the policyowner to use policy loans to pay premiums that are due\n   each year. The policyowner only pays the difference between the premium due and the amount\n   borrowed (plus interest on the policy loan). Depending on the type of policy, a policyowner may be\n   able to use the policy\u2019s cash value and dividends to pay the premium.\n\nComparing Life Insurance Policy Costs\n \uf0a7 The cost of life insurance is largely dependent on an individual\u2019s specific circumstances and\n   requirements. However, cost estimates are useful so that the consumer can consider every factor when\n   making a buying decision. A lower premium doesn\u2019t automatically equate to a lower-cost policy. To\n   that extent, cost indexes have been developed to aid in the process of measuring an insurance policy\u2019s\n   actual cost.\n \uf0a7 Surrender Cost Index: Uses a complicated calculation formula in which the net cost is averaged\n   over the number of years during which the policy was in force to arrive at the average cost-per-\n   thousand for a policy that\u2019s surrendered for its cash value at the end of that period.\n \uf0a7 Net Payment Cost Index: Uses the same formula as the Surrender Cost Index, with the exception\n   that it doesn\u2019t assume that the policy will be surrendered at the end of the period. The net payment\n   cost index is useful if a person\u2019s primary concern is the amount of death benefits provided in the\n   policy. It helps compare future costs (e.g., 10 to 20 years) if a person continues to pay premiums and\n   doesn\u2019t take the policy\u2019s cash value.\n \uf0a7 The interest adjusted cost method calculates the cost of life insurance by taking into account the time\n   value of money (i.e., the investment return on sums placed in premium dollars had these sums been\n   invested elsewhere).\n \uf0a7 The traditional net cost method adds a policy\u2019s premiums and subtracts both dividends (if any) and\n   cash value.\n\nPolicy Proceeds\n \uf0a7 Living Benefits: A living benefit is the option to use some of the future death benefit proceeds before\n   death.\n \uf0a7 Cash Value: The cash (equity) that accumulates and may be borrowed against, used as collateral,\n   utilized as supplemental retirement income, or may be withdrawn for emergencies or other situations\n   in which cash is needed.\n \uf0a7 Accelerated Benefit: Allows a person who\u2019s be certified by a physician as terminally ill to access the\n   death benefit. To be considered terminally ill, a physician must certify that the person has a condition\n   or illness that will result in death within two years. After the certification, the insurance company now\n   knows that it will soon be required to pay out the benefit. As a result, it will allow the person to use\n   some of the proceeds now and deduct it from what\u2019s paid to the beneficiary later.\n \uf0a7 Viatical Settlement: Allows a person who has a terminal illness to sell his existing life insurance\n   policy to a third party for a percentage of the death benefit. The new owner continues to make the\n   premium payments and will eventually collect the full death benefit. The original policyowner is\n   referred to as the viator, while the new third-party owner is referred to as the viatical or viatee.\n \uf0a7 Life Settlement: A life settlement is the sale of an existing life insurance policy to a third party for\n   more than its cash surrender value, but less than its net death benefit. An insured is not required to\n   have a terminal illness to participate in a life settlement.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f \uf0a7 Policy Dividends: Dividends are a refund of a part of the premium under a mutual insurer\u2019s\n   participating policy. The policyowner may use dividends for cash payments, to pay the insurance\n   premium, to purchase additional paid-up whole life insurance, to purchase one-year term insurance, or\n   as an investment to accumulate interest. Although not directly tied to the policy proceeds, dividends\n   are still considered a living benefit.\n \uf0a7 Death Benefit Settlement Options: Although customarily selected by the beneficiary, the\n   policyowner may select a settlement option at the time of the application and may change the option at\n   any time during the insured\u2019s life. If selected by the policyowner, the settlement option cannot be\n   changed by the beneficiary. Death benefit settlement options include:\n     \u2012 Lump-Sum: Death benefit is paid in a single payment, minus any outstanding policy loan\n         balances and overdue premiums. The lump-sum option is considered the automatic (or \u201cdefault\u201d)\n         option for most life insurance contracts.\n     \u2012 Interest Only: The insurance company holds the death benefit for a period and pays only the\n         interest earned to beneficiaries.\n           \u2022 A minimum rate of interest is guaranteed, and the interest must be paid at least annually.\n     \u2012 Fixed Period (Period Certain): The insurer pays proceeds (including interest and principal) in\n         minimum guaranteed dollar payments over a specified number of years.\n     \u2012 Fixed Amount: The insurer pays a fixed death benefit in specified installment amounts until the\n         proceeds are exhausted. The larger the installment payment, the shorter the payout period.\n     \u2012 Life Income: This provides the beneficiary with an income that she cannot outlive. Installment\n         payments are guaranteed for as long as the recipient lives. The amount of each installment is\n         based on the recipient\u2019s life expectancy and the principal benefit.\n     \u2012 Joint and Survivor: Benefits will be paid on a life-long basis to two or more people. This\n         option may include a period certain, and the amount payable is based on the ages of the\n         beneficiaries.\n\nBeneficiaries\n \uf09f There are very few restrictions as to who may be named a beneficiary of a life insurance policy. A\n   beneficiary can be either specific (a person who\u2019s identified by name and relationship) or a class\n   designation (a group of individuals, such as the children of the insured). If no beneficiary is named or\n   if all beneficiaries die before the insured dies, the death benefit will go to the insured\u2019s estate. The\n   policyowner is the ultimate decision-maker. However, in the underwriting process, the underwriter\n   may consider the issue of insurable interest. Examples of who can be beneficiaries include:\n      \u2012 Individuals\n      \u2012 Businesses\n      \u2012 Trust\n      \u2012 Estates\n      \u2012 Charities\n      \u2012 Minors\n      \u2012 Class\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fDistribution By Order of Succession\n \uf0a7 Primary: The first in line to receive death benefit proceeds.\n \uf0a7 Secondary (contingent): The second in line to receive death benefit proceeds if the primary\n   beneficiary dies first.\n \uf0a7 Tertiary: The third in line to receive death benefit proceeds. If one is not named, the death benefit\n   will go to the insured\u2019s estate.\n \uf0a7 Distribution by Descent\n     \u2012 Per Stirpes (meaning by the bloodline): If a beneficiary dies before the insured, benefits from\n         that policy will be paid to that beneficiary\u2019s heirs.\n     \u2012 Per capita (meaning by the head): Evenly distributes benefits among all named living\n         beneficiaries.\n\nChanging a Beneficiary\n \uf0a7 Revocable Beneficiary: The policyowner may change the beneficiary at any time without notifying\n   or obtaining the beneficiary\u2019s permission.\n \uf0a7 Irrevocable Beneficiary: The beneficiary cannot be changed without the beneficiary\u2019s written\n   consent. The irrevocable beneficiary has a vested interest in the policy. Therefore, the policyowner\n   cannot exercise certain rights (e.g., taking out a policy loan) without the beneficiary\u2019s consent.\n\nSpecial Situations\n \uf0a7 Uniform Simultaneous Death Act: If the insured and the primary beneficiary die at approximately\n   the same time as the result of a common accident with no clear evidence as to who died first, the act\n   will assume that the primary beneficiary died first. This allows the death benefit proceeds to be paid to\n   the contingent beneficiary(ies).\n \uf0a7 Common Disaster Provision: With this provision, a policyowner can be certain that if both the\n   insured and the primary beneficiary die within a short period, the death benefits will be paid to the\n   contingent beneficiary.\n \uf0a7 Spendthrift Clause: Prevents the deceased\u2019s creditors from obtaining the death benefit and prevents a\n   beneficiary from recklessly spending benefits by requiring the benefits to be paid in fixed amounts or\n   installments over a certain period.\n \uf0a7 The facility of payment allows the insurance company to pay all or a part of the proceeds to a person\n   who\u2019s not named in the policy, but has a valid right. Facility of payment is often done on behalf of a\n   minor or when the named beneficiary is deceased.\n\nTax Consequences of Life Insurance\n \uf0a7 Premiums that are paid on individual life insurance policies and premiums that are paid for life\n   insurance used for business purposes (the company\u2019s benefit) are generally not tax-deductible.\n   However, exceptions allow premiums to be tax-deductible for:\n     \u2012 Premiums on an insurance policy to benefit a charity\n     \u2012 Premiums on an insurance policy to benefit an ex-spouse as court-ordered alimony\n \uf0a7 Employer-paid premiums that are used to fund group insurance for the benefit of employees are tax-\n   deductible for the employer.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f\uf0a7 Living benefits can have tax implications depending on the situation.\n\uf0a7 Cash Value: For policies that are not surrendered, the cash value grows on a tax-free basis. If the\n  policy is surrendered for its cash value, the portion that exceeds the premiums paid is taxable. As long\n  as the cash value remains in the policy, taxes will never be imposed on any portion, not even the\n  amount that exceeds the cost basis.\n\uf0a7 According to the IRS, proceeds from a policy loan don\u2019t count as taxable income. However, if a\n  policy is surrendered or lapses, the IRS is notified of the taxable event and taxes may be required.\n\uf0a7 Accelerated Death Benefit: Under a life insurance policy, when benefits are paid to a terminally ill\n  person, the benefits are received tax-free.\n\uf0a7 Dividends are received tax-free. However, if the policyowner chooses to leave the dividends with the\n  insurance company as an investment, any interest that accumulates will be subject ordinary income\n  tax.\n\uf0a7 The transfer for value rule applies when a life insurance policy is sold to another party before the\n  insured\u2019s death. For this reason, most states require a viatical settlement company or life settlement\n  company to inform the client that the proceeds could be taxable in certain situations and it should be\n  recommended that they consult with a tax advisor.\n\uf0a7 1035 Exchange: When an existing life insurance policy is assigned to another insurer for a new\n  contract, the transaction may be treated for tax purposes as a Section 1035 exchange. Policy\n  exchanges that qualify as 1035 exchanges are not taxable. A Section 1035 exchange enables the\n  postponement of tax consequences.\n\uf0a7 Under the Economic Benefit Doctrine, any benefit granted to an individual that has an economic or\n  financial value must be included as compensation for income tax purposes in the year in which the\n  benefit is granted. Individual life insurance generally avoids this doctrine since premature death can\n  cause a substantial risk to a surviving family.\n\uf0a7 Life insurance proceeds that are paid to a beneficiary as a lump-sum are generally received tax-free.\n  Additionally, proceeds pass directly to the beneficiary and are not subject to attachment by the\n  insured\u2019s creditors.\n\uf0a7 If death benefits are paid to a beneficiary in installments (as opposed to as a lump-sum), the principal\n  is received tax-free and any interest received is taxable.\n\uf0a7 Another tax cost that\u2019s typically associated with death is the federal estate tax (although most\n  relatively simple estates don\u2019t require the filing of an estate tax return).\n\n     Copyright \u00a9 .

      "content": "AND POLICY ISSUE\n\n  \uf0a7 Underwriting is the process that\u2019s used by an insurance company to determine whether an applicant is\n    insurable and, if the applicant is insurable, how much to charge for premiums.\n  \uf0a7 The underwriter will utilize several different types of information when determining the insurability of\n    the individual.\n  \uf0a7 Material facts can affect an applicant being accepted or rejected.\n  \uf0a7 One of the primary responsibilities of an underwriter is to protect the insurer against adverse selection.\n  \uf0a7 The underwriter classifies each proposed insured\u2019s risk and selects only those with an acceptable risk\n    based on the insured\u2019s underwriting guidelines.\n\n  \uf0a7 The underwriting process involves reviewing and evaluating the applicant\u2019s information and\n    establishing individual guidelines against the insurer\u2019s standards and guidelines for insurability and\n    premium rates. The larger the policy, the more comprehensive and diligent the underwriting process.\n  \uf0a7 The most common sources of underwriting information include:\n       \u2012 The application\n       \u2012 The medical report\n       \u2012 Attending physician\u2019s statement\n       \u2012 The Medical Information Bureau\n       \u2012 Special questionnaires\n      \u2012 Inspection reports\n       \u2012 Credit reports\n  \uf0a7 Application: The application is the starting point and primary source of information that\u2019s used by an\n    insurance company in the risk selection. Although applications differ from company to company, they\n    all have the same general components. Insurable interest must exist between the policyowner and\n    insured at the time that the application is made (not at the time of death/loss).\n  \uf0a7 Insurable interest exists when the death of the insured would have a clear financial impact on the\n    policyowner.\n  \uf0a7 An application has the following three parts:\n      \u2012 Part I of the application includes:\n            \u2022 General information (e.g., age, date of birth, gender, address, marital status, occupation)\n            \u2022 Details about the requested insurance coverage (e.g., type of policy, amount of insurance,\n               name and relationship of the beneficiary, other insurance the proposed insured owns)\n            \u2022 Other information personal information\n                  \u2012 Tobacco use\n                  \u2012 Hazardous hobby\n                  \u2012 Foreign travel\n                  \u2012 Aviation activity\n                  \u2012 Military service\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f    \u2012 Part II of the application includes:\n       \u2022 Medical information and health history\n       \u2022 A medical section which must be completed in its entirety for every application (depending on\n            the proposed policy, this section may be all that\u2019s required in the way of medical information)\n       \u2022 The disclosure that the individual to be insured may be required to take a medical exam or\n            provide a blood test or urine specimen\n    \u2012 Part III of the application includes:\n       \u2022 The agent\u2019s report (statement) which contains the agent\u2019s observations of the applicant\n       \u2022 The applicant\u2019s financial condition, character, background, the purpose of sale, and how\n            long the agent has known the applicant.\n           \u2022 (Because the agent represents the insurance company\u2019s interests, the agent is expected to\n           complete this part of the application thoroughly and truthfully.)\n\uf0a7 Policies below a certain face amount (e.g., $50,000, or even $100,000) will not require additional\n  medical information, other than what\u2019s provided by the application. However, they require a medical\n  report for further information.\n\uf0a7 Credit Reports: An applicant\u2019s credit history may be used for underwriting and determines the\n  likelihood of the premium payments being made. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires the\n  applicant to be notified in writing if a credit report will be used. The applicant must also be notified if\n  the premium is increased because of a credit rating.\n\uf0a7 Warranty: Warranties are statements that are guaranteed to be literally true. A warranty that\u2019s not\n  literally true in every detail, even if it\u2019s made in error, is sufficient to render a policy void.\n\uf0a7 Representations include statements made by the applicant that are substantially true to the best of his\n  knowledge but are not warranted as exact in every detail.\n\uf0a7 Medical Report: A medical report is often used for underwriting policies with higher face amounts. If\n  the medical section\u2019s information warrants further investigation into the applicant\u2019s medical\n  conditions, the underwriter may need an attending physician\u2019s statement (APS).\n\uf0a7 Inspection Reports: This report provides information about the applicant\u2019s character, lifestyle, and\n  financial stability. Due to their cost, inspection reports are typically only requested for more extensive\n  coverages. However, company rules vary as to the sizes of policies that require a report by an outside\n  agency. When an investigative consumer report is used in connection with an insurance application,\n  the applicant has the right to receive a copy of the report.\n\uf0a7 Companies are allowed to obtain inspection reports under The Fair Credit Reporting Act. The FCRA\n  regulates how credit information is collected and used to protect the rights of the consumers for whom\n  an inspection or credit report has been requested. It established procedures for the collection and\n  disclosure of information obtained on a consumer through investigation and credit reports.\n\uf0a7 If an insurance company requests a credit report, the consumer must be notified in writing. This report\n  provides information about the applicant\u2019s character, lifestyle, and financial stability. When an\n  investigative consumer report is used in connection with an insurance application, the applicant has\n  the right to receive a copy of the report.\n\uf0a7 Medical Information Bureau (MIB): The MIB is a non-profit trade organization that maintains\n  medical information about individuals. Information from the MIB is used by life and health insurance\n  companies to help avoid adverse selection by applicants. It detects misrepresentations, helps identify\n  fraudulent information, and controls the cost of insurance. Information received or released from the\n  Medical Information Bureau about a proposed insured may be released to the proposed insured\u2019s\n  physician. An insurance company will NOT notify the MIB if an application is declined. One of the\n  primary purposes of the MIB report is to allow an insurer to avoid high-risk applicants.\n\n     Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f\uf0a7 USA PATRIOT Act: The USA PATRIOT Act was enacted in 2001 and requires insurance\n  companies to establish formal anti-money laundering programs. The purpose of the act is to detect and\n  deter terrorism. A life insurance policy can be cash-surrendered, which can be an attractive money-\n  laundering vehicle because it allows criminals or terrorists to put dirty money in and take clean money\n  out in the form of an insurance company check.\n\uf0a7 Special Questionnaires: These are used for applicants who are involved in particular activities, such\n  as aviation, military service, or hazardous occupations or hobbies. The questionnaire provides details\n  regarding the amount of time the applicant spends on these activities.\n\uf0a7 Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA): The FCRA regulates the amount of credit information\n  can be collected and protects the rights of consumers for whom an inspection or credit report has been\n  requested. Information regarding an individual\u2019s credit standing and general reputation is contained in\n  a consumer report. The FCRA established procedures for the collection and disclosure of information\n  obtained on consumers through investigation and credit reports. If an insurance company requests a\n  credit report, the consumer must be notified of this fact in writing. The applicant has the right to\n  receive a copy of the report when an investigative consumer report is used in connection with an\n  insurance application.\n\n\uf0a7 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) is a privacy rule that provides\n  federal protections for an individual\u2019s health information. Furthermore, HIPAA gives patients a\n  variety of rights concerning individually identifiable health information. When an agent submits an\n  application that reveals personal information regarding an applicant, the agent is responsible for\n  providing the insurance applicant with privacy notices.\n\uf0a7 In applicable situations, producers must also secure an HIV consent form from the applicant and\n  communicate that blood tests may be required. In other words, despite the fact that the insurer requires\n  a blood test as part of its regular underwriting activity, it must still secure a signed consent form which\n  indicates to the applicant that any blood taken will be screened for HIV and that he\u2019s providing\n  permission for such testing to be completed.\n\uf0a7 Applicant Ratings: Once all of the information about a given applicant has been reviewed, the\n  underwriter seeks to classify the applicant\u2019s risk to the insurer. This evaluation is referred to as risk\n  classification.\n\n\uf0a7 Once all the information about a given applicant has been reviewed, the underwriter will utilize\n  several different types of information in determining the insurability of the individual and the risk that\n  the applicant poses to the insurer. This evaluation is known as risk classification. The following rating\n  classification system is used to categorize the favorability of a given risk:\n\uf0a7 Preferred: This classification is characterized by low risk and low premiums. Some of the following\n  may result in a policy being issued with a preferred insurance premium:\n    \u2012 The applicant doesn\u2019t smoke or drink.\n    \u2012 The applicant has good personal/family health history.\n\uf0a7 Standard: This classification is characterized by average risk with no extra ratings or restrictions. The\n  policies will have standard terms and rates.\n\uf0a7 Substandard: This classification is characterized by high risk and rated up (higher) premiums due to\n  chronic conditions, insulin diabetes, or heart disease.\n\uf0a7 Declined: This means the applicant is not insurable because the potential of loss to the insurance\n  company is too high. The applicant has a terminal illness or too many chronic conditions.\n\n     Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f\uf0a7 Field underwriting is completed by an agent. Unlike the insurer, the agent has face-to-face contact\n  with the applicant, which can aid the insurer in risk selection. As field underwriters, agents help\n  reduce the chance of adverse selection, assure that the application is filled out completely and\n  correctly, collect the initial premium, and deliver the policy. Other duties include:\n    \u2012 Forwarding the application to the insurer in a timely manner\n    \u2012 Seeking additional information about the applicant\u2019s medical history (if requested)\n    \u2012 Notifying the insurer of any suspected misstatements in the application\n    \u2012 Assuring that the application is filled out completely and correctly\n    \u2012 Collecting the initial premium\n\uf0a7 In addition, agents have the responsibility and duty to solicit only profitable business. Therefore, an\n  agent\u2019s solicitation and prospecting efforts should focus on cases that fall within the insurer\u2019s\n  underwriting guidelines and represent profitable business to the insurer.\n\uf0a7 Upon policy delivery, agents must deliver the life insurance buyer\u2019s guide and policy summary to the\n  applicant. A life insurance producer may also be required to obtain a signature on a good health\n  statement at the time of policy delivery.\n\n\uf0a7 If an agent realizes that an applicant has made an error on an application, the agent must correct the\n  information and have the applicant initial the changes.\n\uf0a7 An incomplete application will be returned to the agent.\n\uf0a7 The agent can NEVER change the application without the customer present to initial the changes.\n\uf0a7 Buyer\u2019s Guide: This document provides general information about the types of life insurance policies\n  available in simple language that can be understood by the average person. (i.e., a general description\n  of whole life, a general description of term life, essential characteristics of variable life, etc.).\n\uf0a7 Policy Summary: This provides specific information about the policy purchased, such as the\n  premium and benefits. The policy summary allows a person to quickly identify the specific \u201chealth\n  insurance\u201d that she purchased (e.g., Medicare Supplement, Major Medical, Critical Illness, Long-term\n  Care, etc.).\n\uf0a7 Suitability Form: This ensures that the customer is best suited for the policy he\u2019s purchasing and help\n  prevent the sale of unnecessary insurance. For example, a 75-year-old customer who\u2019s living off of\n  Social Security is not suitable for a single premium deferred annuity because she would be giving up a\n  large sum of cash that she may need to live on and could possibly not live long enough to collect on\n  the annuity.\n\uf0a7 Signatures: The agent and the applicant are both required to sign the application. If the applicant is a\n  person other than the proposed insured (except for a minor child), the proposed insured must also sign\n  the application. In most states, having a policyowner (applicant) who\u2019s different from the insured\n  (parent and minor child) is considered third party ownership. For an insurance policy, once a minor\n  reaches the age of 15, he\u2019s eligible to enter into a contract.\n\uf0a7 If an agent fails to deliver a fully completed and accurate application, the insurance company will\n  return the agent\u2019s application.\n\n\uf0a7 Agents should make every effort to collect the initial premium with each application. However, if the\n  premium is not collected with the application, the policy will not become valid until it\u2019s collected.\n\uf0a7 Once the initial premium is collected, the agent issues a premium receipt to the applicant.\n\n     Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f\uf0a7 The only time a customer will receive a receipt is if he pays his initial premium at the time of\n  application. No receipt will be given at any other time.\n\uf0a7 There are two types of premium receipts which determine when coverage will begin\u2014conditional\n  receipts and binding receipts.\n    \u2012 Conditional Receipt: The producer issues a conditional receipt to the applicant when the\n       application and premium are collected. The conditional receipt indicates that coverage will be\n       effective once certain conditions are met. If the insurer accepts the coverage as applied for, the\n       coverage will take effect from the application or medical exam date, whichever is later.\n    \u2012 Binding Receipt: The binding receipt\u2014also referred to as the temporary insurance agreement\u2014\n       provides coverage from the date of the application regardless of whether the applicant is\n       insurable. Coverage typically lasts for 30 to 60 days, or until the insurer accepts or declines the\n       coverage. Binding receipts are rarely used in life insurance; instead, they\u2019re often used in auto\n       and homeowners\u2019 insurance. Under a binding receipt, coverage is guaranteed until the insurer\n       formally rejects the application. This may also be described as the insurer being bound to\n       coverage until the application is formally rejected. Even if the proposed insured is ultimately\n       found to be uninsurable, coverage is still guaranteed until rejection of the application.\n\n\uf0a7 As described under the conditional receipt, coverage is not effective without the collection of the\n  initial premium, approval of the application, and followed by policy issuance and delivery. If the\n  initial premium doesn\u2019t accompany the application, the premium must be collected by the agent. In\n  some cases, the insurer requires the agent to collect a good health statement from the insured at the\n  delivery time. If the initial premium is not submitted with the application, the policy effective date is\n  established by the insurer. In this case, it could be the date the policy is issued.\n\uf0a7 Generally, for a policy to be in effect:\n     \u2012 The insurer must issue the policy\n     \u2012 The insured must submit the initial premiums, and\n     \u2012 (If applicable) The insured must sign a statement of continued good health.\n\uf0a7 The effective date is important for two reasons, (1) it identifies when the coverage is effective and (2)\n  it establishes the date by which future annual premiums must be paid.\n\uf0a7 Backdating: This is the process of predating the application by a certain number of months to\n  achieve a lower premium. Listing a younger age at the time of application results in a lower premium.\n  A backdated application results in a backdated policy effective date if it\u2019s approved by the insurer.\n  Applications can typically only be backdated for up to six months. This process is also referred to as\n  \u201csaving age.\u201d In addition, the next premium is due at the backdated anniversary date.\n\n\uf0a7 Policy issue occurs when the insurer \u201capproves\u201d the application (i.e., it is \u201cissuing the policy\u201d).\n\uf0a7 The insurance issued contract is sent to the sales agent for delivery to the applicant. The policy is\n  generally NOT sent to the policyowner because the sales agent should personally explain it to the\n  policyowner.\n\uf0a7 Technically a policy could be ISSUED and not be delivered for days or weeks later.\n\uf0a7 Constructive Delivery: Policy delivery may be accomplished without physically delivering the\n  policy into the policyowner\u2019s possession.\n\n     Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f\uf0a7 Constructive delivery occurs if the insurance company intentionally relinquishes all control over the\n  policy and turns it over to a person who\u2019s acting for the policyowner, including the company\u2019s own\n  agent. Mailing the policy to the agent for unconditional delivery to the policyowner also constitutes\n  constructive delivery, even if the agent never personally delivers the policy. If the company instructs\n  the agent not to deliver the policy unless the applicant is in good health, there\u2019s no constructive\n  delivery.\n\uf0a7 The Statement of Continued Good Health: This verifies that the insured has not become ill,\n  injured, or disabled during the policy approval process (the time between the submission of the\n  application and the delivery of the policy), or did not submit the initial premium with the application.\n  It\u2019s used when the applicant did not submit the initial premium with the application in such cases.\n  Common company practice requires that, before leaving the policy, the agent must collect the\n  premium and obtain a signed statement from the insured which attests to her continued good health.\n  Statements of good health are also used when reinstating a policy.\n\uf0a7 Personal delivery of the policy is a good practice since it allows the producer to explain the coverage\n  to the insured (e.g., riders, provisions, and options). Personal delivery also builds trust and reinforces\n  the need for the coverage. All of the following acts can be considered means of policy delivery\u2014\n  mailing the policy to the agent, mailing the policy to the applicant, and the agent personally delivering\n  policy. Delivery is important since the policyowner must sign a document to indicate that the policy\n  has been received (and the free-look period and contestable period commences).\n\n     Copyright \u00a9 .

      "content": "Principles of Group Insurance\n  \uf0a7 Unlike individual life insurance which is written on a single life, group life insurance is written on\n    more than one life.\n  \uf0a7 Group life insurance is typically written for employee-employer groups and is most often written as an\n    annual renewable term policy.\n  \uf0a7 An important underwriting principle of group life insurance is that the insurance must cover all or a\n    large percentage of the persons in the group.\n\n Contributory and Non-Contributory Plans\n  \uf0a7 Contributory \u2013 An employee group plan in which employees share the cost. The insurance company\n    requires at least 75% of all employees to participate.\n  \uf0a7 Non-Contributory \u2013 An employee group plan in which employees do NOT share in the cost. The\n    insurance company requires 100% of all employees to be eligible.\n\n Features of Group Insurance\n  \uf0a7 Features that separate group insurance from individual insurance include:\n      \u2012 With group insurance:\n            \u2022 The individual is not required to provide evidence of insurability since group underwriting\n                is involved.\n            \u2022 The insureds (employees) are not policyowners and only receive a \u201ccertificate of\n                insurance\u201d to prove that they have coverage.\n            \u2022 The employer is the policyowner and receives one master contract (policy).\n      \u2012 Group insurance has lower overall costs due to lower administrative, operational, and selling\n         expenses associated with group plans.\n      \u2012 The master contract allows for the flow of insureds, or the entering and exiting under the policy\n         as members join and leave the group.\n      \u2012 Group insurance is typically issued as annually renewable level term insurance, which provides a\n         fixed amount of coverage throughout the term of the contract.\n  \uf0a7 Although the employer is the policyowner, the employee still has an \u201cincident of ownership\u201d by\n    naming the beneficiary.\n\n Eligible Groups\n  \uf0a7 Groups must exist for a purpose other than obtaining insurance.\n  \uf0a7 Among others, group life insurance can be formed by the following organizations:\n     \u2012 Single-employee groups\n     \u2012 Multiple-employee groups\n     \u2012 Labor unions and trade associations\n     \u2012 Credit/debit groups\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 .

Otherwise, he may need to provide\n   evidence of insurability.\n\nClassification of Risk\n \uf0a7 Insurers require a minimum number of group members/employees to participate in a group insurance\n   plan in order to minimize adverse selection.\n \uf0a7 Adverse selection means that the people who are most likely to need life insurance will purchase life\n   insurance in greater numbers than those who are in good health.\n \uf0a7 After all necessary information is collected on an applicant, the underwriter will classify the applicant\n   based on the degree of risk assumed.\n \uf0a7 The following rating classification system is used to categorize the favorability of a given risk:\n     \u2012 Preferred: Low risk and lower premiums\n     \u2012 Standard: Average risk with no extra ratings or restrictions\n     \u2012 Substandard: High risk (rated up) with higher premiums\n     \u2012 Declined: Not insurable - Potential of Loss to Insurance Company is Too High\n \uf0a7 Lower risks tend to have lower premiums.\n \uf0a7 If an applicant is too risky, the insurer will decline coverage\n\nHow Benefits Are Determined\n \uf0a7 Most employers will establish benefit schedules according to the following:\n     \u2012 Earnings\n     \u2012 Employment position\n     \u2012 Flat benefit\n \uf0a7 Conversion to an individual policy: If a member\u2019s coverage is terminated, the member and his\n   dependents may convert their group coverage to individual whole life coverage without being required\n   to show proof of insurability.\n \uf0a7 Conversion Period: An individual must apply for individual coverage within 31 days after the date of\n   group coverage termination.\n \uf0a7 Under the group policy, an individual is covered during the conversion period.\n \uf0a7 Group Policy Termination: If the master policy is terminated, each individual member who has been\n   insured for at least five years is permitted to convert to an individual policy that provides coverage up\n   to the face value of the group policy\n\nGroup Credit Life\n \uf0a7 Group Credit Life: Group credit life policies are established by organizations (e.g., banks and finance\n   companies) and stipulate that, if the insured dies before a loan is repaid, the policy benefits will be\n   used to settle the loan balance.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fTaxation of Group Life Insurance Plans\n  \uf0a7 For a group life insurance plan to receive favorable tax treatment, there are specific requirements to\n    ensure that an average employee is not discriminated against in favor of higher-level employees.\n  \uf0a7 If premiums for group life insurance are paid by the employee, they\u2019re not tax-deductible.\n  \uf0a7 If premiums for group life insurance are paid by the employer, they can be deducted as a business\n    expense.\n  \uf0a7 Proceeds from a group life policy are tax-free if they\u2019re taken in a lump-sum.\n  \uf0a7 Proceeds taken in installments will be subject to taxes on the interest portion of the installments.\n\nGroup versus Individual Insurance\n                      GROUP                                                       INDIVIDUAL\nOne master policy is issued to the group                    Each covered person possesses her own policy\nCovered members have the same\n                                                            Each person selects her benefits /coverages\nbenefits/coverages\nOnly eligible group members can apply                       Any individual can apply\nGroup underwriting                                          Individual underwriting\nCoverage ceases when the member leaves the                  Coverage continues as long as the premium is\ngroup                                                       paid\nLess expensive with few restrictions                        More expensive with more restrictions\n\n  \uf0a7 The essentials of group versus individual forms of insurance apply to life and health insurance.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 .

      "content": "Purpose and Function\n  \uf0a7 While life insurance protects against the risk of premature death, annuities protect against the risk of\n    living too long and outliving income.\n  \uf0a7 Annuities are a way of providing a stream of income for a guaranteed period.\n  \uf0a7 Simply stated, an annuity is started with a large sum of money that will be paid out in installments\n    over a preset period or until the money is exhausted.\n  \uf0a7 The monthly amount of benefit an annuitant receives is based on factors such as principal amount, rate\n    of interest earned by the annuity, and length of the payout period.\n  \uf0a7 The contract owner is the individual who purchases the annuity, pays the premiums, and has rights of\n    ownership.\n      \u2012 The owner may be the annuitant, the beneficiary, or neither.\n  \uf0a7 During the liquidation phase of an annuity contract, the income benefits that are distributed at regular\n    intervals are normally payable to the annuitant.\n  \uf0a7 The beneficiary is the person who receives survivor benefits upon the annuitant\u2019s death.\n  \uf0a7 Most annuities have two phases\u2014the accumulation (pay-in) period and the annuity (pay-out) period.\n  \uf0a7 The accumulation period may typically continue even after the purchase payments cease.\n  \uf0a7 The annuity period is also referred to as the liquidation period, annuitization period, or payout period.\n    This is the time when the money that has accrued during the accumulation period is paid-out in the\n    form of payments to the annuitant\n\n Structure and Design\n  \uf0a7 Funding Method: When defining an annuity, (describe how it\u2019s paid for) + (describe how it pays the\n    annuitant) SINGLE PREMIUM (the annuitant pays once) + DEFERRED (it starts paying the\n    annuitant at least one year later).\n  \uf0a7 An annuitant CANNOT make installment payments and get paid immediately.\n  \uf0a7 Single Payment = a lump-sum payment\n  \uf0a7 Periodic Payments (Flexible Premiums) = installments paid over a period of time\n\n Date Income Payments Begin\n  \uf0a7 Immediate Annuities: Purchased with a lump-sum payment, and will start providing income\n    payments within the first year, typically starting 30 days from the purchase date. Its purpose is to\n    provide for the liquidation of a principal sum.\n      \u2012 Commonly used to structure the payment of liability insurance settlements, lottery winnings, and\n         other large sums.\n      \u2012 This type of annuity is also referred to as a single premium immediate annuity (SPIA).\n  \uf0a7 Deferred Annuities: These start providing income payments after the first year and are typically\n    purchased with either a single lump-sum payment (single premium deferred annuity) or from monthly\n    payments (flexible premium deferred annuity).\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f     \u2012 For example, a fixed deferred annuity pays out a fixed amount for life starting at a future date.\n       Interest credited to the cash values of annuities is deferred until distribution. Other characteristics\n       of deferred annuities include:\n         \u2022 When a deferred annuity is canceled during the early contract years, the insurer will\n           generally assess a back-end load (referred to as surrender charge).\n         \u2022 The \u201cbailout\u201d feature, which may be found in single premium deferred annuity contracts,\n           waives surrender charges when the interest rate falls below a stated level.\n         \u2022 Before a deferred annuity contract can be terminated for its surrender value, the insurer must\n           first obtain authorization from the owner.\n         \u2022 The accumulation value of a deferred annuity is equal to the sum of premiums paid, PLUS\n           interest earned, MINUS expenses and withdrawals\n\nPayout Options\n \uf0a7 Straight Life Income Payout Option: This option pays the annuitant a guaranteed income for her\n   lifetime. When the annuitant dies, no further payments are made to any person. This offers protection\n   against exhaustion of savings due to longevity.\n \uf0a7 Fixed Amount Option: This option provides the annuitant with a fixed payment until the contract\n   value is exhausted, regardless of when that will be. If the annuitant dies before the contract is\n   depleted, the beneficiary receives the remainder.\n \uf0a7 Cash Refund Payout Option: This option pays a guaranteed income to the annuitant for life. If the\n   annuitant dies before all the money is exhausted, a lump-sum cash payment of the remaining funds is\n   paid out to the annuitant\u2019s beneficiary.\n \uf0a7 Installment Refund Payout Option: This option pays a guaranteed income to the annuitant for life.\n   If the annuitant dies before the money is exhausted, the beneficiary will continue to receive the same\n   monthly installment payments.\n \uf0a7 Life with Period Certain Payout Option (Life Income with Term certain): This option is\n   designed to provide the annuitant with guaranteed payments for her life or to the beneficiary for a\n   specific period. It designed so that benefit payments will continue for a minimum number of years\n   regardless of when the annuitant dies.\n      \u2012 For example, if an annuitant selects a 20-year period certain and dies after 10 years, the\n         beneficiary will receive payments for another 10 years.\n \uf0a7 Joint and Full Survivor Payout Option: This option pays out the annuity to two or more people\n   until the last annuitant dies. If one of them dies, the other will continue to receive the same income\n   payments. There are two additional options made available with a joint and survivor payout:\n      \u2012 Joint and Two-Thirds Survivor: Survivor will have payments reduced to two-thirds of the\n         original payment.\n      \u2012 Joint and One-Half Survivor: Survivor will have payments reduced to one-half of the original\n         payment.\n\nInvestment Configuration\n \uf0a7 Annuities can also be defined by their investment configuration, which will determine the amount of\n   income the benefits pay. The two types of annuity classifications are fixed and variable.\n     \u2012 Fixed Annuities: Provide a guaranteed rate of return. Fixed annuities credit interest at a rate\n       that\u2019s no lower than the contract\u2019s guaranteed rate.\n     \u2012 Variable Annuity: Doesn\u2019t provide a guaranteed rate of return because of the investment risk.\n       The cash value is based on the results of these investment funds. A statement must be provided\n       to the owner of the annuity at a minimum of once per year.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f     \u2012 Variable annuities can be classified as either immediate or deferred. Insurers that deal with\n         variable annuities are subject to dual regulation by the SEC and the state\u2019s Office of Insurance\n         Regulation.\n \uf0a7 Accumulation Units: In a variable annuity, the value of the accumulation units varies depending on\n   the value of the securities investment that\u2019s a part of a variable annuity.\n \uf0a7 Annuity Units: When the variable annuity is to be paid out to the annuitant, the accumulation units\n   are converted into annuity units. These payouts can vary from month to month and will depend on the\n   investment results. Although the number of units doesn\u2019t change, the value of each unit will change.\n   The amount of each variable annuity benefit paid to an annuitant varies according to the market value\n   of the securities in the separate account.\n \uf0a7 Equity Indexed Annuities (EIAs): A type of fixed annuity that offers the potential for a higher return\n   than a standard fixed annuity. These EIAs may be tied to the Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 Index or the\n   Composite Stock Price Index.\n \uf0a7 Single-Life Annuities: Characterized by having only one annuitant.\n \uf0a7 Tax-Sheltered Annuities: Limited exclusively for employees of religious, charity, or educational\n   groups. These annuities are also referred to as 403(b) plans.\n     \u2012 Accumulation payments often come from voluntary salary reductions.\n     \u2012 The annuitant may have an individual account contract\n \uf0a7 Income Tax Treatment of Annuity Benefits: Annuity benefit payments consist of principal and\n   interest. The portion of annuity benefits that consists of principal (premiums paid into the annuity\n   during the accumulation period) is not taxed and may be referred to as the owner\u2019s \u201ccost basis.\u201d The\n   portion of the annuity benefits that\u2019s interest earned on the principal is taxable as ordinary income.\n   Interest income must be reported for federal income tax purposes upon receiving distributions or\n   income benefits from the contract.\n \uf0a7 Exclusion Ratio: This is a simple way to determine what portion of each annuity benefit payment is\n   taxable: Exclusion ratio = Investment in the contract \u00f7 Expected return.\n \uf0a7 Partial withdrawal: This is when funds are taken from an annuity before age 59 1/2. The withdrawal\n   is considered 100% interest and is therefore taxable as ordinary income.\n \uf0a7 A 10% tax penalty is applied if a distribution is received before the annuitant reaches age 59 1/2. After\n   this age, withdrawals don\u2019t incur the 10% penalty tax, but are taxable as ordinary income.\n \uf0a7 1035 Exchange: This provision applies to annuities. If an annuity is exchanged for another annuity, a\n   gain (for tax purposes) is not realized. This is also true for a life insurance policy or an endowment\n   contract that\u2019s exchanged for an annuity. However, an annuity cannot be exchanged for a life\n   insurance policy.\n \uf0a7 Qualified Annuity Plan: This plan is a tax-deferred arrangement that\u2019s established by an employer to\n   provide retirement benefits for employees. The plan is qualified because of having met government\n   requirements.\n      \u2012 A qualified annuity is an annuity that\u2019s purchased as part of a tax-qualified individual or\n         employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as an individual retirement account (IRA).\n      \u2012 In the accumulation phase, a qualified deferred annuity may be used to fund an IRA and permit\n         continued contributions within the maximum limits set by the IRS. IRA funds that have been\n         annuitized no longer permit contributions.\n\nSuitability of Annuity Sales for Senior Customers\n \uf0a7 When making recommendations to a senior consumer regarding the purchase or exchange of an\n   annuity, an agent must have reasonable grounds for believing that this recommendation is suitable for\n   the senior consumer. This recommendation should be based on the facts disclosed by the senior\n   consumer and should include an evaluation of his investments and other insurance products along\n   with his financial situation and needs.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 .

      "content": "Qualified Plans versus Non-Qualified Plans\n   \uf0a7 Qualified plans are retirement plans that meet federal requirements and receive favorable tax\n     treatment. Qualified plans provide tax benefits and must be approved by the IRS. The plans must be\n     permanent, in writing, communicated to employees, and cannot favor highly paid employees,\n     executives, or stockholders.\n   \uf0a7 The two primary types of qualified plans are defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n   \uf0a7 To comply with ERISA minimum participation standards, qualified retirement plans must allow the\n     enrollment of all employees who are over the age of 21 who have been employed for at least one year.\n   \uf0a7 If more than 60% of a qualified retirement plan\u2019s assets are in key employee accounts, the plan is\n     considered \u201ctop-heavy.\u201d\n   \uf0a7 Qualified plans have the following features:\n        \u2012 Employer contributions are tax-deductible as a business expense.\n        \u2012 Employee contributions are made with pre-tax dollars and the earnings grow tax-deferred until\n          withdrawal.\n        \u2012 In a qualified retirement plan, the annual addition to an employee\u2019s account cannot exceed the\n          maximum limits as set by the Internal Revenue Service.\n   \uf0a7 Non-qualified plans have the following characteristics:\n        \u2012 They\u2019re not required to be approved by the IRS\n        \u2012 They can discriminate in favor of certain employees\n        \u2012 Contributions are not tax-deductible (i.e., they\u2019re after-tax)\n        \u2012 Interest earned on contributions is tax-deferred until withdrawn at retirement\n\n  Tax Benefits of Qualified Plans\n   \uf0a7 Employer\u2019s contributions are tax-deductible and not treated as taxable income to the employee.\n   \uf0a7 Employee contributions are made with pre-tax dollars.\n   \uf0a7 All funds grow tax-deferred and employees are only taxed at the time of withdrawal.\n\n  Withdrawals and Taxation\n   \uf0a7 Withdrawals made by the employee are treated as taxable income.\n   \uf0a7 Withdrawals made by the employee prior to the age of 59 1/2 are assessed an additional 10% penalty\n     tax.\n   \uf0a7 Distributions are mandatory by April 1 following the year in which the person turns age 72. The\n     failure to take the required withdrawal results in a 50% excise tax on those funds.\n   \uf0a7 Funds may be withdrawn prior to the employee reaching age 59 1/2 without the 10% penalty tax for\n     the following reasons:\n       \u2012 The employee dies or becomes disabled\n       \u2012 A loan is taken on the plan\u2019s proceeds\n       \u2012 The withdrawal is the result of a divorce proceeding\n       \u2012 The withdrawal is made to a qualified rollover plan\n       \u2012 The employee elects to receive annual level payments for the remainder of his life\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f \uf0a7 The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 was enacted to provide minimum\n   benefit standards for pension and employee benefits plans, including fiduciary responsibility,\n   reporting and disclosure practices, and vesting rules.\n \uf0a7 The overall purpose of ERISA is to protect the rights of workers who are covered under an employer-\n   sponsored plan.\n\nEmployer-Sponsored Plans\n \uf0a7 Defined benefit plans pay a specified benefit amount upon the employee\u2019s retirement.\n     \u2012 When the term pension is used, it\u2019s typically referring to a defined benefit plan.\n     \u2012 In a defined benefit plan, the benefit is based on the employee\u2019s length of service and earnings.\n     \u2012 Individual and group deferred annuities mostly fund defined benefit plans.\n \uf0a7 Defined contribution plans don\u2019t specify the exact benefit amount until distribution begins.\n     \u2012 The two main types of defined contribution plans are profit-sharing and pension plans.\n          \u2022 Profit-sharing plans are a type of retirement plan that set aside a portion of the firm\u2019s net\n              income for distributions to employees who qualify under the plan. Plans must provide\n              participants with the formula being used by the employer for contributions. The\n              contributions may vary on a yearly basis, and contributions and interest are tax-deferred\n              until withdrawal.\n          \u2022 With pension plans, employers contribute to a plan based on the employee\u2019s compensation\n              and years of service; it\u2019s not based on company profitability or performance.\n \uf0a7 Money purchase plans allow employers to contribute a fixed annual amount, apportioned to each\n   participant, with benefits based on funds in the account upon retirement.\n \uf0a7 Target benefit plans have a target benefit amount.\n \uf0a7 Stock bonus plans are similar to a profit-sharing plan, except that the employer\u2019s contributions are\n   not dependent on profits and benefits are distributed in the form of company stock.\n \uf0a7 401(k) plans allow employers to make tax-deductible contributions to the participant, either by\n   placing a cash bonus into the employee\u2019s account on a pre-tax basis or the individual taking a reduced\n   salary with the reduction placed pre-tax in the account. The account\u2019s funds are taxable at the time of\n   withdrawal.\n \uf0a7 Tax-sheltered annuities are a particular class of retirement plans that are available to employees of\n   specific charitable, educational, or religious organizations.\n \uf0a7 Simplified employee pension (SEP) plans are basically an arrangement whereby an employee\n   (including a self-employed individual) establishes and maintains an IRA to which the employer\n   contributes. Employer contributions are not included in the employee\u2019s gross income. A primary\n   difference between a SEP and an IRA is that considerably more money can be contributed to an\n   employee\u2019s SEP plan.\n \uf0a7 A Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plan is available to small businesses\n   (including tax-exempt and government entities) that employ no more than 100 employees who\n   received at least $5,000 in compensation from the employer during the previous year. An employer\n   can choose to make non-elective contributions of 2% of compensation on behalf of each eligible\n   employee. To establish a SIMPLE plan, the employer must not have an existing qualified plan.\n \uf0a7 Keogh (HR-10) plans are for self-employed persons, such as doctors, farmers, lawyers, or other sole-\n   proprietors. Keoghs may be defined contribution or defined benefit plans. Contributions are tax-\n   deductible, and interest and dividends are tax-deferred.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f\uf0a7 IRAs are established by individuals who have earned income and want to save for retirement.\n\uf0a7 Traditional IRAs allow for an individual to contribute a limited amount of money per year, and the\n  interest earned is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Contribution limits are indexed annually and are\n  currently at $6,000 per year or 100%of earned income. Any person who\u2019s 50 or older may contribute\n  an additional $1,000, thereby making her maximum annual contribution $7,000. Some individuals\n  may deduct IRA contributions from their taxes based on their adjusted gross income (AGI), but all\n  withdrawals are taxable as ordinary income. If an individual or spouse is not covered by an employer-\n  sponsored retirement plan, the entire contribution is tax-deductible (regardless of AGI). Withdrawals\n  that are made prior to age 59 1/2 are assessed an additional 10% penalty tax.\n\uf0a7 To avoid penalties, traditional IRA owners must begin to receive payment from their accounts by no\n  later than April 1 following the year in which they turn the age of 72.\n\uf0a7 Funds may be withdrawn from an IRA prior to the employee reaching the age of 59 1/2 without being\n  subject to the 10% penalty tax (however, the interest is still taxable) for any of the following reasons:\n     \u2012 Death, disability, first-time homebuyers (up to $10,000 lifetime), education (no dollar\n         maximum), health insurance premiums (if unemployed), and qualified medical expenses\n\uf0a7 Roth IRAs are designed so that withdrawals are received income tax-free. Contributions to Roth\n  IRAs are subject to the same limits as traditional IRAs, but are not tax-deductible. Interest on\n  contributions is not taxable as long as the withdrawal is a qualified distribution. Qualified\n  distributions must occur after five years, or due to the death or disability of the individual, or for a\n  first-time homebuyer (up to $10,000), or having reached the age of 59 1/2.\n\uf0a7 A rollover is the transfer of funds from an IRA or qualified plan to another.\n\uf0a7 Rollovers are subjected to a 20% withholding tax if eligible rollover funds are received personally by\n  a participant in a qualified plan unless the funds are deposited into a new IRA or qualified plan within\n  60 days of distribution.\n\uf0a7 Funds that are transferred directly from one qualified IRA to another qualified IRA are not subject to\n  this withholding tax. This also includes a trustee-to-trustee transfer of rollover funds instead of\n  personally receiving the funds and then rolling them over. This election permits the participant to\n  avoid mandatory income tax withholding on the amount transferred.\n\uf0a7 A surviving spouse who inherits IRA benefits from a deceased spouse\u2019s qualified plan is eligible to\n  establish a rollover IRA in their own name.\n\uf0a7 Rollover contributions to an individual retirement annuity (IRA) are unlimited by dollar amount.\n\n     Copyright \u00a9 .

This approach determines the total funds available to a family from all sources and\n    subtracts the amount needed to meet their financial objectives. It takes into consideration:\n      \u2012 Final expense fund\n      \u2012 Housing fund\n      \u2012 Education fund\n      \u2012 Monthly income\n      \u2012 Emergency fund\n      \u2012 Income needs (if disabled or ill)\n      \u2012 Retirement income\n      \u2012 Estate conservation (using life insurance to enable heirs to pay estate taxes)\n      \u2012 \u201cNeeds\u201d include ANY PERSON or ENTITY who\u2019s dependent on that person (e.g., child,\n           charity, or pet)\n  \uf0a7 The needs approach to personal life insurance planning may involve creating a lump-sum to provide\n    for such things as education, retirement, and charitable contributions.\n  \uf0a7 The needs approach to personal life insurance planning also includes the creation of an emergency\n    reserve fund that\u2019s primarily designed to cover the cost of unexpected expenses.\n\n Business Uses of Life Insurance\n  \uf0a7 Buy-Sell agreements\u2014also referred to as business continuation agreements\u2014are used to assure the\n    business\u2019s ownership is appropriately transferred upon the death or disability of an owner or partner.\n    Third-party ownership of life insurance policies is widely used in business insurance and estate-\n    planning situations.\n\n Buy-Sell Funding for Sole Proprietors\n  \uf0a7 There\u2019s a two-step business continuation plan to keep a business running after the proprietor\u2019s death,\n    whereby the employee takes over management of the business:\n     1. Buy-Sell Plan: An attorney drafts a buy-sell plan which indicates the employee\u2019s agreement to\n         purchase the proprietor\u2019s estate and sell the business at a price that has been agreed upon\n         beforehand.\n     2. Insurance Policy: The employee purchases a life insurance policy on the life of the proprietor.\n         The employee is the policyowner, beneficiary, and pays the premiums. Upon the proprietor\u2019s\n         death, the funds from the policy are used to purchase the business.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fBuy-Sell Funding for Partnerships\n \uf0a7 There are two types of buy-sell agreements for partnerships:\n     1. Cross-purchase plans\n     2. Entity plans\n \uf0a7 In a cross-purchase plan, each partner buys, pays the premiums, and is the beneficiary of a life\n   insurance policy on each of the other partners. The amount of the policy is equivalent to each partner\u2019s\n   share of the business. When one partner dies, each of the other partners receives the death benefit from\n   the life insurance on the deceased partner, which is then used to purchase the business ownership of\n   the deceased partner.\n \uf0a7 In an entity plan, the partnership itself agrees to buy the deceased partner\u2019s share of the business.\n   Entity plans are best for businesses with several partners. In this case, the business purchases, pays the\n   premiums, and is the beneficiary of life insurance on each partner.\n\nBuy-Sell Funding for Closely Held Corporations\n \uf0a7 Unlike a partnership, a closely held corporation (e.g., an incorporated family business) is legally\n   separate from its owners and exists after one or more owners dies. A closely held corporation may\n   purchase either buy-sell plans (i.e., either cross-purchase or entity). The difference is that an entity\n   plan is referred to as a stock redemption plan for closely held corporations.\n \uf0a7 Closely Held Corporation Cross-Purchase Plan\n     \u2012 Similar to partnership cross-purchase plans, a closely held corporation cross-purchase plan\n         requires surviving stockholders to purchase the deceased stockholder\u2019s interest in the company.\n         The deceased stockholder\u2019s estate sells the interest to the surviving stockholders. The\n         corporation is not part of the buy-sell plan. Each stockholder owns, pays the premiums, and is\n         the beneficiary of life insurance on each of the other stockholders in an amount that\u2019s equal to\n         his share of the corporation\u2019s purchase price.\n \uf0a7 Closely Held Corporation Stock Redemption Plan\n     \u2012 Similar to the partnership entity plan, the corporation purchases it, is the owner, pays the\n         premiums, and is the beneficiary of life insurance policies on each stockholder. The amount of\n         life insurance is equal to each stockholder\u2019s share of the corporation\u2019s purchase price. When a\n         stockholder dies, the corporation purchases, or redeems, the deceased stockholder\u2019s share.\n \uf0a7 Key Person Insurance: The purpose of key person insurance is to prevent the financial loss that may\n   result when an owner, officer, or manager dies.\n     \u2012 It pays for finding and training a replacement if the key employee dies prematurely.\n     \u2012 The company purchases, owns, pays the premiums, and is the beneficiary of the key person\u2019s life\n         insurance policy.\n     \u2012 The premiums are not deductible for income tax purposes. However, the death proceeds received\n         by the business are not taxable.\n\nEmployee Benefit Plans\n \uf0a7 Deferred compensation is an executive benefit that an employer can use to pay a highly paid employee\n   at a later date, such as upon disability, retirement, or death.\n \uf0a7 A salary continuation plan works the same as deferred compensation except that the employer funds\n   the plan rather than the employee. The employer establishes an agreement whereby an employee will\n   continue to receive income payments upon death, disability, or retirement.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved"

      "content": "ACCIDENT INSURANCE\nCovered Perils and Losses\n  Covered Perils\n  The probability or risk of getting an illness or becoming disabled (both due to accidents and diseases) is\n  morbidity.\n\n  Illness (Sickness or Disease)\n  \u2022 A sickness (or illness) is best thought of as an internal occurrence that becomes manifest. It may have\n  a sudden onset or develop over time.\n\n  Accidents\n  \u2022 An accident is an unintended occurrence resulting in a loss caused by an external source; it\u2019s fixed in\n  time and space.\n\n  Covered Losses\n  There are five distinct types of losses covered within the broad field of health insurance\u2014medical\n  expense, disability, dental expense, accidental injury, and long-term care.\n\n      \uf0a7    Hospital expenses\n      \uf0a7    Surgical expenses\n      \uf0a7    Physician expenses\n      \uf0a7    Outpatient care\n\n          Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  \u2022 Policyowners can control the premium cost of a disability income plan by electing a longer\n  elimination period than may otherwise be desired. Since the benefits that are received from an\n  individually funded disability policy are income-tax-free, policies limit benefits to a percentage of a\n  person\u2019s pre-disability gross earnings.\n\n  Accident Insurance\n  \u2022 Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) insurance\u2014a prominent type of accident insurance\u2014\n  pays a lump-sum benefit amount when an accident results in the insured\u2019s death or dismemberment.\n\nClasses of Health Insurance\n  The \u201cclass\u201d of insurance is another way to categorize the various kinds of health insurance policies,\n  including:\n    \uf0a7 Individual versus group contracts\n    \uf0a7 Private versus government insurance\n    \uf0a7 Limited risk versus comprehensive policies\n\n  Individual versus Group Contracts\n\n         Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  Private versus Government Insurance\n\n  \u2022     The federal government offers:\n      \uf0a7 Medical insurance for seniors through Medicare, and\n      \uf0a7 Disability insurance through Social Security (OASDI)\n\n  \u2022 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)\u2014also simply referred to as the\n  Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014created state-based and state-administered health insurance exchanges.\n\n  \u2022 TRI-CARE is the federal government health plan for active duty and retired service members, as well\n  as their families, and survivors. It has three options:\n      1. TRI-Care Prime \u2013 which uses military treatment\n      2. TRI-Care Extra \u2013 which is a PPO\n      3. TRI-Care Standard \u2013 a fee-for-service option\n\n  Comprehensive versus Limited\n\n      \uf0a7 For example, major medical insurance covers most recognized medical treatments unless specifically\n        excluded.\n\n      \uf0a7 For example, an aviation policy provides benefits for accidental death or dismemberment if death or\n        injury results from an aviation accident during a specified trip.\n\nLimited Insurance Policy Types\n  Limited risk policies cover a specific risk. An example of a limited risk policy is accidental death and\n  dismemberment contracts, which provide benefits only when covered losses occur as a result of accidental\n  bodily injury. State insurance departments require insurance companies to include a \u2018Notice to the Insured\u2019\n  stating that the contract is a Limited Benefit Policy.\n  A limited risk is different from a special risk. A special risk policy covers unusual hazards that are not\n  normally covered under ordinary accident and health insurance.\n\n           Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fA limit risk policy covers a common risk in a limited manner. The policy may be \u201climited\u201d in the perils\ncovered (accidents or a named disease), the time frame (a specific trip), or the nature of the loss (death or\ndismemberment).\n\nAccident-Only\n\u2022 Accidental death and dismemberment insurance pays a lump-sum benefit amount in the event of\naccidental death or dismemberment. In general, the insured must die within 90 days of the accident for the\ndeath benefit to be paid.\n\nSpecified (Dread) Disease\n\u2022   Dread disease policies provide limited benefits for a specific disease, such as cancer or heart disease.\n\nCritical Illness (Specified Conditions)\n\u2022 Critical illness contracts pay a lump sum to the insured upon the diagnosis and survival of a critical\nillness. Benefits can be used to cover non-medical expenses. Covered conditions typically include heart\nattacks, strokes, organ transplants, and end stage renal failure.\n\nHospital Indemnity (Income)\n\u2022 While the insured is confined to a hospital, hospital indemnity insurance policies pay a specified\namount on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis directly to the insured (not the hospital). Payment is based\nonly on the number of days confined in a hospital.\n\nCredit Disability\n\u2022 Credit disability insurance plans protect a lender against the disability of a borrower before the\ndebtor pays off a debt. Credit disability insurance covers the cost of monthly debt payments while the\ninsured is disabled. The lender or creditor is the policy owner and the beneficiary, while the debtor is the\ninsured and typically pays the premiums. This type of contract may also be referred to as decreasing\n(term) disability insurance.\n\nBlanket Insurance (E.g., Teams and Passengers)\n\u2022 Insurance carriers issue blanket health insurance policies to cover group or association members\nwho are exposed to the same risks but at different times. The circumstances are constant, but the group\u2019s\ncomposition (individuals within the group) continually changes. As with other group contracts, the group\nis the policy owner; however, unlike other group policies, individual enrollment is not required, and\ncertificates of coverage are not issued.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  \u2022 Prescription drug policies cover the cost of prescription drugs that are not dispensed in a hospital or\n  extended care facility. Most prescription drug policy plans have a co-payment requirement when a\n  prescription is being filled.\n\n  \u2022 Some private health care plans cover the costs of audiological tests, hearing aid evaluation, and partial\n  or full coverage for hearing aids.\n\n  \u2022 Vision care coverage typically pays the cost of eye examinations by ophthalmologists and\n  optometrists. The cost of contact lenses or eyeglasses is often partially covered.\n\n  \u2022 Short-term medical insurance policies typically last for as little as 90 days and may provide\n  coverage for as long as 364 days (just less than one year). Short-term plans are a stripped-down version of\n  medical expense coverage, and consumers have traditionally used these plans as interim coverage to\n  bridge gaps between more robust forms of coverage. In return for a lower premium, insurance buyers must\n  cope with many of the restrictions that are eliminated in major medical policies by the ACA. These\n  policies may be medically underwritten and may exclude pre-existing conditions.\n\nDental Insurance\n  Most dental plans require a review of suggested treatment to ensure it\u2019s reasonable and necessary. This\n  process is defined as a predetermination of benefits, pre-certification, or prior authorization of\n  benefits. All dental plans include limitations, exclusions, and caps on annual benefits.\n  Other common exclusions involve:\n    \uf0a7 Cosmetic procedures unless they\u2019re due to an accident\n    \uf0a7 Services provided by governmental agencies\n    \uf0a7 Treatment that\u2019s covered by Workers\u2019 Compensation\n    \uf0a7 Duplicate dentures or the replacement of lost or stolen dentures\n    \uf0a7 Oral hygiene instructions or similar training\n    \uf0a7 Exotic procedures, such as splinting and restoring occlusion\n  Replacement of prosthetic appliances (e.g., retainers) is excluded for five years after the benefits are paid\n  Dental plans may also include limitations on benefits for dental emergency services that are offered\n  outside the network area.\n\n         Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fDental insurance may be covered by a medical expense plan. These integrated plans include a single\ndeductible that may be satisfied by either dental or medical expenses. Dental insurance may also be\noffered as a standalone plan. When dental coverage is offered as an optional benefit, the plan is\nconsidered non-integrated.\nDental plans may be either scheduled or non-scheduled:\n    \uf0a7 Scheduled plans organize coverage into treatment categories, with stated limits for each.\n    \uf0a7 Non-scheduled plans pay benefits on a usual, customary, and reasonable basis (UCR).\nMost dental plans provide coverage for diagnostic and preventive treatment.\nOther categories of treatment are as follows:\n    \uf0a7 Restorative or Restoration Benefits \u2013 Fillings, crowns, and other services to restore a tooth\u2019s natural\n      function.\n    \uf0a7 Oral Surgery \u2013 Includes coverage for tooth extraction and surgery treating injuries, diseases, or jaw\n      defects.\n    \uf0a7 Endodontics \u2013 Root canals or treatment for diseases of the dental pulp within the teeth.\n    \uf0a7 Periodontics \u2013 This involves care due to gum disease.\n    \uf0a7 Prosthodontics \u2013 This benefit covers the replacement of missing teeth, artificial dentures, and\n      bridgework.\n    \uf0a7 Orthodontics \u2013 This pays benefits for corrective teeth devices, such as braces and retainers.\n    \uf0a7 Pediatric Dentistry \u2013 These services are for children and adolescents.\n    \uf0a7 Oral Pathology \u2013 This involves tissue biopsy for the treatment of oral diseases, such as oral cancer.\n\nThis coverage typically operates similarly to individual dental plans. Dental plans generally don\u2019t have a\nconversion privilege. Dental plans are subject to COBRA requirements.\n\n\u2022     They generally divide services into three categories:\n    1. Routine or basic diagnostic and preventive services \u2013 includes x-rays, cleaning, and fluoride\n       treatment, etc.\n    2. Restorative services (that are not routine) \u2013 includes fillings, oral surgery, and periodontics\n    3. Major services \u2013 includes crowns, orthodontics, facial reconstructions, or bridgework\n\n         Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f\u2022     Many plans cover:\n    \uf0a7 100% of the costs for routine care\n    \uf0a7 80% for restorative services\n    \uf0a7 50% for major services\n\n    \uf0a7 For example, this plan may cover diagnostic and preventive services on a UCR basis but contains a\n      schedule of benefits for other covered services.\n\n         Copyright \u00a9 .

The entire class of\n     policies is treated as a distinct provider.\n\n  Basic Group Plan Characteristics\n   \uf0a7 The nature of the sponsoring group must be acceptable.\n   \uf0a7 State laws specify the minimum number of persons to be covered under a group policy.\n   \uf0a7 Employers may differentiate the benefits offered according to the common characteristics that\n     distinguish the employee classes (union versus non-union, full-time versus part-time, etc.).\n   \uf0a7 Employers cannot discriminate against specific individuals within a particular employee class.\n\n  Eligible Groups\n   \uf0a7 To qualify for group health coverage, the group must be a natural group.\n   \uf0a7 The term \u201cnatural group\u201d means that it must have been formed for some reason other than to obtain\n     insurance.\n   \uf0a7 Taft-Hartley Trusts are formed as a result of collective bargaining between a labor union and an\n     employer.\n   \uf0a7 Employers are prohibited from paying funds directly to a labor union to provide group health\n     insurance to its members.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 .

Requirements may\n      vary with each state.\n\nAlternative Forms of Group Insurance\n  Multiple Employer Trusts (METs)\n    \uf0a7 The Multiple Employer Trust (MET) is a method of marketing group benefits to employers that\n      have few employees.\n    \uf0a7 A MET combines multiple employers (10 or more) into a single pool for the purpose of providing\n      group insurance.\n    \uf0a7 A MET holds the master contract rather than the participating employers.\n\n         Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f \uf0a7 An employer that wants to obtain coverage for employees from a Multiple Employer Trust must first\n   become a member.\n \uf0a7 A MET typically funds benefits with an insurance contract that\u2019s purchased from an insurance\n   company.\n \uf0a7 A MET may be insured and administered by a third-party administrator (TPA).\n \uf0a7 These trusts are also referred to as 501(c)(9) trusts after the relevant section of the Internal Revenue\n   Code.\n \uf0a7 Partially self-funded trusts limit potential losses by purchasing stop-loss insurance.\n \uf0a7 State regulations pertaining to METs vary.\n\nMultiple Employer Welfare Arrangements (MEWA)\n \uf0a7 A Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement is similar to a MET; in fact, the terms are often used\n   interchangeably.\n \uf0a7 MEWAs are tax-exempt entities.\n \uf0a7 MEWAs consist of two or more employers that have joined to provide affordable health benefits for\n   their employees on a self-funded (or self-insured) basis.\n \uf0a7 Employees who are covered by a MEWA are required by law to have an employment-related common\n   bond.\n \uf0a7 MEWAs are risk retention instruments. The law treats them as \u201cemployee welfare benefit plans\u201d and\n   subjects them to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) mandates, which often\n   supersede state insurance department regulations.\n\nSelf-Insurance\n \uf0a7 \u201cSelf-insurance\u201d does NOT mean \u201cno insurance.\u201d\n \uf0a7 Many self-insuring employers cap their financial risk by buying stop-loss insurance coverage from an\n   insurance company.\n \uf0a7 The stop-loss coverage reimburses the employer if the total amount of covered claims exceeds the\n   policy\u2019s risk retention limit.\n\nAdministration Services Only (ASO)\n \uf0a7 With Administration Services Only (ASO) contracts, the employer purchases specific administrative\n   services from an insurer or a TPA.\n \uf0a7 Self-funded plans commonly use the services of an insurance company to act as a third-party\n   administrator.\n\nSmall Employer Group Insurance\n \uf0a7 A small employer is generally defined as a business with a range of employees from two to 50.\n \uf0a7 All full-time employees must have access to coverage.\n \uf0a7 The level of coverage must reflect general group insurance requirements.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 .

This is based on the Constitutional Doctrine of\n     Interstate Comity.\n   \uf0a7 Having a single state of jurisdiction means that the group insurance contract must only conform to that\n     one state\u2019s laws and regulations.\n   \uf0a7 The producer will generally deliver a group health insurance policy to the location of the employer.\n   \uf0a7 Federal regulatory requirements apply regardless of state lines.\n\n  The Termination of a Group Plan\n   \uf0a7 An employer or fiduciary must provide a 45-day notice of termination of the plan to all those covered.\n   \uf0a7 If a group health plan terminates, employees may convert to an individual health plan without\n     evidence of insurability.\n\n  Impact of Termination on Covered Individuals\n   \uf0a7 Unless the law states otherwise, coverage for an employee and his dependents can terminate on the\n     date employment is terminated.\n   \uf0a7 Termination may occur in other circumstances, including:\n       \u2012 An employee ceases to be eligible (regardless of the reason)\n       \u2012 The master policy is surrendered or canceled\n       \u2012 An employee fails to make a required contribution\n       \u2012 The end of a continuation of benefits period for employees and dependents that follows the\n          termination of a person\u2019s employment\n   \uf0a7 Coverage under group plans may be continued for employees and dependents even after employment\n     ends due to COBRA or other applicable laws or policy provisions.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fContinuation and Conversion\nExtension of Benefits\n  \uf0a7 An extension of benefits covers open, existing claims when an employee or dependent is sick or\n    disabled at the time the insured\u2019s group membership ends.\n  \uf0a7 This extension doesn\u2019t cover new claims.\n  \uf0a7 Disability benefits will continue until the disability ends.\n  \uf0a7 Medical insurance offers coverage that continues to pay for active claims at the time of termination,\n    including hospitalization or medical care, but generally not for more than 12 months.\n\nConsolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)\n  \uf0a7 COBRA mandates employers to provide employees and their beneficiaries with group health coverage\n    following a qualifying event.\n  \uf0a7 COBRA eligibility begins as soon as they qualify for coverage under their employer\u2019s group medical\n    plan.\n  \uf0a7 COBRA temporarily continues a person\u2019s group insurance; it doesn\u2019t convert them to an individual\n    plan.\n\nCovered Employers\n  \uf0a7 COBRA covers employers with 20 or more employees.\n  \uf0a7 These companies are referred to as \u201cCOBRA Groups.\u201d\n\nQualifying Events\n  \uf0a7 The law defines the following circumstances as qualifying events for COBRA:\n     \u2012 The insured employee dies\n     \u2012 The insured employee divorces a covered spouse\n     \u2012 An insured dependent becomes too old to be covered on the group plan\n     \u2012 The insured employee qualifies for Social Security disability benefits\n     \u2012 The employee leaves his job, either voluntarily (resigns or retires) or because he\u2019s terminated for\n         any reason other than gross misconduct\n\nNotification Period\n  \uf0a7 Employers must notify employees or their dependents if the insured employee becomes eligible for\n    COBRA.\n  \uf0a7 The law requires employers to provide employees notice of their option to choose COBRA no later\n    than 14 days after the qualifying event (termination, etc.).\n\nDecision Period\n  \uf0a7 Employees have up to 60 days to decide whether to accept the coverage.\n  \uf0a7 If the employee or dependent fails to notify the employer in time, the right to elect COBRA coverage\n    is lost.\n  \uf0a7 This 60-day period begins on the date of the qualifying event or when notice is received, whichever is\n    later.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 .

Remember, collecting two or more benefits is a prohibited act.\n\n  \uf0a7 The purpose of a short-term disability (STD) policy is to quickly replace a percentage of the insured\u2019s\n    income while she recovers from a temporary injury or illness that prevents her from working but is less\n    serious in nature.\n      \u2012 Common uses included surgery and childbirth.\n  \uf0a7 Long-term disability (LTD) plans provide longer benefit periods and are typically reserved for an injury\n    or illness that\u2019s more serious in nature.\n\nQUALIFYING FOR BENEFITS\n  \uf0a7 Disability income policies primarily define \u201cdisability\u201d as the inability to perform tasks or earn an\n    income.\n  \uf0a7 Disability income policies also include \u201cmedical definitions\u201d of disability based on a direct physical\n    injury rather than any consequential income loss.\n  \uf0a7 Some contracts cover losses at work, while others do NOT.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 .

All rights reserved  \n\f  \uf0a7 Partial disability is defined as a person\u2019s inability to perform some of the key duties of his own\n    occupation or the inability to work at his own job full-time.\n  \uf0a7 This benefit encourages disabled insureds to return to work without fear of losing all their benefits.\n  \uf0a7 The traditional partial disability benefit was 50% of the total disability benefit for a maximum of six\n    months.\n[EXAM TIP: Assume this is true for the licensing exam.]\n\n  \uf0a7 Residual disability is a proportional disability benefit that\u2019s based on loss of income. The amount of\n    income lost defines the degree of disability. The insured receives a percentage of the total disability\n    benefit.\n    For example: If Frances suffers a disability that results in a 40% loss of income,\n    she will have a residual disability rating of 40%. Frances\u2019s policy will pay her\n    40% of her policy\u2019s total disability benefit.\n\n  \uf0a7 The recurrent disability clause applies when the insured returns to work after a disability but suffers a\n    relapse.\n  \uf0a7 Under the terms of the recurrent disability provision, the relapse is considered part of the original\n    disability if it occurs within six months after the insured returns to work. As such, the following\n    conditions apply:\n      \u2012 No new elimination period (benefits begin immediately)\n      \u2012 No new benefit period (If the insured has a five-year benefit period and has already received six\n         months of benefits before returning to work, he now has 4.5 years remaining.)\n\n  \uf0a7 Presumptive disability identifies certain conditions that automatically qualify an insured for the total\n    benefit.\n  \uf0a7 Losses that qualify as presumptive disabilities include the following:\n      \u2012 Double dismemberments\n      \u2012 Total and permanent loss of sight\n      \u2012 Total and permanent loss of hearing\n      \u2012 Total and permanent loss of speech\n\nConcurrent Disability\n  \uf0a7 When disabling events occur in tandem and result in a single period of disability, the condition is\n    referred to as a concurrent disability.\nDelayed Disability\n  \uf0a7 In some cases, total disability doesn\u2019t occur immediately after an accident.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 .

It also classifies disabilities as\n    either a \u201ctemporary disability\u201d or a \u201cpermanent disability.\u201d\n  \uf0a7 Workers\u2019 Compensation is the primary coverage when it\u2019s paid.\n\nINDIVIDUAL DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE\n  \uf0a7 Individual disability income insurance is an occupational contract.\n  \uf0a7 Insurers underwrite the risk based on the applicant\u2019s occupation as well as personal characteristics.\n  \uf0a7 The issued policy provides 24/7 coverage for losses due to injuries and illnesses.\n\n  \uf0a7 The benefit period is the maximum length of time that disability income benefits will be paid to the\n    disabled insured.\n  \uf0a7 Individual short-term disability policies provide benefits for six months to two years.\n  \uf0a7 Individual long-term disability policies are characterized by benefit periods of two years or more per\n    disability.\n\n  \uf0a7 The elimination period is also referred to as the waiting period.\n  \uf0a7 This is the time immediately following the start of a disability when benefits are not payable.\n  \uf0a7 The elimination period serves as a time-based deductible in a disability income policy.\n  \uf0a7 The longer the waiting period selected, the lower the policy premium.\n\n  \uf0a7 A probationary period occurs only once, and it\u2019s at the policy\u2019s inception.\n  \uf0a7 In a disability insurance policy, the probationary period defines the period that must elapse before claims\n    due to illness are covered.\n  \uf0a7 The probationary period\u2019s purpose is to exclude pre-existing sicknesses from coverage, which may not\n    manifest themselves until after the policy is in force.\n  \uf0a7 The probationary period helps protect the insurer against adverse selection.\n  \uf0a7 Probationary periods don\u2019t apply to accidents.\n\n  \uf0a7 Disability income insurers that issue individual policies limit coverage to a percentage of the insured\u2019s\n    income.\n    For example, if an applicant\u2019s gross earned income is $3,000 per month, an insurer will\n    allow him to buy a policy with a monthly benefit of up to $1,800.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f\uf0a7 Percent-of-Earnings Approach This approach defines the benefit as a fixed percentage of the\n  insured\u2019s pre-disability earnings.\n\uf0a7 This approach is primarily used in group insurance.\n\uf0a7 If the insured\u2019s income increases, the benefit also increases to maintain the percentage.\n\uf0a7 Flat Amount Approach Individual disability policies use the flat amount method, which defines\n  benefits as a specific dollar amount.\n\uf0a7 It remains fixed despite changes in income unless the insured has purchased riders allowing him to\n  increase his coverage.\n\n\uf0a7 When calculating a disability claim, we must account for the elimination period.\n  For example, let\u2019s assume that Ellen owns a policy with a $1,000 per month total disability\n  benefit and a 60-day elimination period. If Ellen is totally disabled for 90 days, she\u2019s subject to\n  the elimination and will only collect a single month of benefits (90 days \u2013 60 days), or $1,000.\n\n\uf0a7 Premium rates are based on the monthly benefit as well as:\n    \u2012 The length of the waiting period and the benefit period\n    \u2012 The age, sex, income, and health of the insured\n    \u2012 The occupation of the insured\n\n\uf0a7 Most individual disability policies are sold with a level premium.\n\uf0a7 Groups or association-sponsored plans often have five-year premium age bands, and the premium\n  increases as the insured ages.\n\n\uf0a7 Personal underwriting criteria includes the insured\u2019s:\n    \u2012 Age\n    \u2012 Sex (gender)\n    \u2012 Occupation\n        \u2022 An insured\u2019s occupation is an essential element of her morbidity risk. Morbidity is\n            considered the likelihood of a person becoming disabled.\n        \u2022 Individuals in certain professions (e.g., physicians and attorneys) engage in less hazardous\n            work. Also, their income potential is much higher than their potential benefits.\n        \u2022 Other white-collar and gray-collar occupations are considered riskier, especially since the\n            incentive to return to work is not as great.\n        \u2022 Many blue-collar occupations have a higher incidence of physical injury and the highest\n            morbidity rates. In such cases, the insurer will restrict policy terms and limit the benefit\n            period\u2019s length to either two or five years.\n\n\uf0a7 This provision allows the insurance carrier to automatically change the premium or benefit if the insured\n  has not informed the insurer of a change in risk.\n\uf0a7 If the insured\u2019s new occupation is riskier, the benefit decreases.\n\uf0a7 If the insured\u2019s new occupation is less risky, the premium decreases.\n\n     Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f\uf0a7 The relation of earnings to insurance limits the total amount of benefits paid to the amount of pre-\n  disability income, even if the available insurance from multiple policies is greater than the income lost.\n\uf0a7 If the available insurance that covers a loss is greater than the loss itself, each policy\u2019s benefit is reduced\n  on a pro-rata basis.\n\n\uf0a7 This type of rider is also referred to as an exclusion rider or waiver for impairments.\n\uf0a7 Insurers use this rider to permanently exclude certain losses if the risk is too high or too uncertain.\n\uf0a7 It allows insurers to cover most risks for an applicant while still charging a standard premium.\n\n\uf0a7 The rehabilitation benefit encourages individuals to actively participate in their recovery.\n\uf0a7 The rehabilitation benefit facilitates vocational training to prepare insureds for a new occupation.\n\uf0a7 The rehabilitation benefit provision requires the insurer to pay the approved cost of a rehabilitation\n  program as long as the insured remains disabled and active in the program.\n\n\uf0a7 The non-disabling injury benefit pays up to a specified amount if the insured suffers an injury and no\n  other claim is filed.\n\n\uf0a7 Disability insurance policies are either non-cancelable and guaranteed renewable or guaranteed\n  renewable.\n\uf0a7 Neither type of policy can be canceled or non-renewed by an insurer unless the insured fails to pay his\n  premium.\n\n\uf0a7 If a policy is non-cancelable, the insurer guarantees the premium rate for the contract\u2019s life as it existed\n  when the insurer issued the policy.\n\n\uf0a7 If the policy is guaranteed renewable, the insurance carrier has the right to raise rates if the cost of\n  disability claims exceeds expectations.\n\uf0a7 The law prohibits an insurance company from raising policy premiums on a particular individual.\n\uf0a7 A company may raise rates on an entire class of policies. This is referred to as raising rates on a \u201cclass\u201d\n  basis because it\u2019s based on the entire pool of affected contracts.\n\uf0a7 Guaranteed renewable policies are more common, especially for classes of employment with higher\n  levels of morbidity risk.\n\n\uf0a7 Disability income policies typically require the insured to be actively working for a stated number of\n  hours per week if coverage extends past the age of 65.\n\n\uf0a7 The more common exclusions in a disability income policy include:\n   \u2012 War (declared or undeclared)\n   \u2012 Intentionally self-inflicted injuries\n\n     Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f    \u2012 Non-commercial aviation\n    \u2012 Military service\n    \u2012 All illegal occupations\n\n\uf0a7 This benefit applies when an accident results in a catastrophic loss, defined as death, the permanent loss\n  of limbs, or a permanent loss of one or more of the senses (sight, hearing, or speech).\n\uf0a7 The death benefit paid under accidental death coverage is referred to as the principal sum.\n\uf0a7 The dismemberment benefit is referred to as the capital sum.\n\uf0a7 The principal sum is the rider\u2019s face amount, while the capital sum is typically 50% of the principal sum.\n\n\uf0a7 Some disability policies allow the insured to take an optional lump-sum payment rather than periodic\n  income. This is referred to as an elective indemnity option.\n\uf0a7 The elective indemnity option is also used in policies that facilitate transfers of ownership related to\n  disabilities, such as disability buyout policies.\n\n\uf0a7 This is an indemnity rider that pays an additional sum on top of the regular monthly disability benefit\n  based on the number of days that the insured is confined to a hospital.\n\uf0a7 The hospital confinement rider also waives the elimination period while the insured is hospitalized.\n\n\uf0a7 The return of premium rider refunds premiums if the insured doesn\u2019t have a claim.\n\n\uf0a7 This rider returns all premiums to the policy owner at the age of 65 if no claims have been made over\n  the contract\u2019s life.\n\n\uf0a7 The lifetime extension rider extends the benefit period beyond the age of 65 if the insured is totally\n  disabled as a result of an injury or illness that occurs before the age of 65.\n\n\uf0a7 The Social Security rider coordinates individual disability policy benefits with Social Security\n  Disability Insurance (SSDI) and other forms of social insurance, such as Workers\u2019 Compensation.\n\uf0a7 An individual disability policy is relatively expensive, and it pays regardless of whether SSDI or other\n  social benefits apply.\n\uf0a7 By shifting some coverage from a policy\u2019s basic, individual disability benefit to a Social Insurance\n  Supplement, a consumer accepts coordination of benefits on some of the policy\u2019s benefits in exchange\n  for a lower premium.\n\uf0a7 The insured will ultimately receive sufficient insurance, either from the insurance company or the\n  government benefit.\n\n\uf0a7 This rider is a short-term benefit that addresses the insured\u2019s needs during the initial six to 12 months of\n  disability.\n\uf0a7 The additional monthly benefit rider can also fill a coverage gap during the five-month SSDI waiting\n  period.\n\n     Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  \uf0a7 This rider helps guarantee that a person\u2019s coverage will keep pace with his income.\n  \uf0a7 The future increase option (FIO) \u201cguarantees\u201d that the insured can purchase additional amounts of\n    disability income insurance at various specified future dates without evidence of insurability.\n  \uf0a7 The insured can exercise this option as long as his income has increased.\n  \uf0a7 Also, the insured must exercise the guaranteed insurability rider if it\u2019s available or lose the option.\n\n  \uf0a7 This rider offsets the impact of inflation that can erode a fixed income\u2019s purchasing power.\n  \uf0a7 The COLA rider indexes the disability benefits that are paid for an active claim to changes in the\n    Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n  \uf0a7 This rider doesn\u2019t increase coverage like an FIO; instead, the COLA rider increases the benefits that are\n    paid once a claim has been made.\n  \uf0a7 This rider is also only found on long-term disability policies.\n    For example, a $1,000 per month benefit with a COLA rider may be increased each year\n    by the lesser of the inflation rate as determined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or a\n    specified percentage stated in the policy (generally 5%).\n\nGROUP DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE PLANS\n  \uf0a7 The group must be a natural group.\n  \uf0a7 Insurers base premiums on the group\u2019s aggregate.\n  \uf0a7 Employers may sponsor multiple plans and restrict participation per plan according to the class of the\n    employees.\n  \uf0a7 Insurance carriers require a minimum level of participation to avoid adverse selection.\n\n  \uf0a7 Group policies often don\u2019t have probationary period provisions. Instead, most group disability plans\n    require new participants to fulfill a minimum required length of service before becoming eligible for\n    coverage.\n\n  \uf0a7 Group insurance policies have an elimination period.\n  \uf0a7 For example, let\u2019s assume that an employer allows employees two weeks of sick leave per year, a six-\n    month short-term disability plan, and long-term disability insurance. The benefit design may include the\n    following:\n      \u2012 A five-day or 10-day elimination period for the short-term disability benefit, and\n      \u2012 A 180-day elimination period for the long-term disability benefits\n  \uf0a7 Ideally, the package design allows participants to move seamlessly between the different disability\n    benefits.\n\n  \uf0a7 The benefit periods for group insurance mirror those for individual insurance policies.\n\n  \uf0a7 Group insurance policies define disability benefits as a percentage of an insured\u2019s wages.\n  \uf0a7 The benefit amount changes as the employee\u2019s compensation changes.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  \uf0a7 Group disability plans coordinate benefits with other groups and social insurance programs, such as\n    Social Security.\n  \uf0a7 Group plans are secondary to Workers\u2019 Compensation for work-related claims.\n  \uf0a7 Some group disability plans limit coverage to non-occupational disabilities.\n    [EXAM TIP: In a real-world group, disability insurance can be \u201coccupational\u201d or \u201cnon-\n    occupational\u201d insurance. For purposes of the licensing exam, we suggest for students to consider\n    it to be \u201cnon-occupational.\u201d]\n\n  \uf0a7 Group insurance plans often provide both total disability and partial disability benefits.\n  \uf0a7 As with individual plans, group disability can include short-term plans or long-term plans.\n  \uf0a7 The labels \u201cshort-term\u201d disability and \u201clong-term\u201d disability are used a little differently in group plans.\n\n  \uf0a7 Group short-term disability plans have short maximum benefit periods of 13 weeks (where allowed by\n    law) or 26 weeks.\n  \uf0a7 Benefits are typically paid weekly and range from 50% to 100% of the individual\u2019s income.\n  \uf0a7 The definition of disability is the insured\u2019s own occupation.\n\n  \uf0a7 Group long-term disability plans provide maximum benefit periods of two years or more, often\n    extending to the insured\u2019s retirement age.\n  \uf0a7 Benefit amounts are generally limited to between 50% and 70% of the participant\u2019s income.\n  \uf0a7 In some cases, the employer will pay for a benefit that\u2019s equal to 50% of their employees\u2019 wages and\n    allow employees to enhance their coverage level up to 20% at their own expense.\n  \uf0a7 Long-term plans often use an \u201cown occupation\u201d definition of total disability for the first two years of\n    disability and then switch to an \u201cany occupation\u201d definition.\n\nBUSINESS USES FOR DISABILITY INSURANCE\n  \uf0a7 Insurers use disability insurance to facilitate business continuation in the event of a disabling sickness or\n    injury.\n  \uf0a7 Policies used for business continuation are individually underwritten.\n  \uf0a7 While group insurance is designed for the average worker, these policies benefit owners, key employees,\n    and the organization.\n\n  \uf0a7 Business overhead expense (BOE) insurance covers business expenses and payroll costs if the owner\n    becomes disabled.\n  \uf0a7 BOE policies don\u2019t insure the disabled owner\u2019s income.\n  \uf0a7 BOE contracts cover the costs of the day-to-day business operations to help the enterprise continue\n    functioning.\n  \uf0a7 Insurers sell BOE to professionals in private practice, self-employed business owners, partners, and\n    close corporations in which a business owner:\n      \u2012 Directly generates a significant portion of company income, or\n      \u2012 Directly oversees day-to-day operations\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f\uf0a7 Rather than a fixed indemnity, business overhead expense policies pay a maximum monthly amount for\n  covered expenses such as:\n    \u2012 Rent or mortgage payments\n    \u2012 Utilities\n    \u2012 Telephone and internet service\n    \u2012 Leased equipment\n    \u2012 Employee wages\n    \u2012 The cost to hire a temporary replacement\n\n\uf0a7 Disability buy-out policies fund disability buy-sell agreements much the same way life insurance\n  policies do.\n\uf0a7 The buy-out plan sets forth the terms for transferring the ownership share of a business; the insurance\n  provides the funds.\n\uf0a7 In the cross-purchase plan, each partner buys a policy that covers each of the other owners. The value\n  of each disability policy benefit equals 50% of each partner\u2019s $200,000 share.\n\n\uf0a7 In an entity buy-sell plan, the company purchases a policy on each partner or shareholder. The\n  company is the beneficiary of each policy and uses the funds to buy out the disabled partner or\n  shareholder.\n\n    Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  \uf0a7 Unlike typical disability income insurance contracts, disability buy-out policies contain a provision that\n    allows the insurer to pay a lump-sum benefit.\n  \uf0a7 Disability buy-sell policies also have lengthy elimination periods, often as long as two years.\n\n  \uf0a7 Key-person disability insurance indemnifies the business for a key person\u2019s lost services.\n  \uf0a7 This type of coverage pays a monthly benefit or lump sum if an essential person is disabled.\n  \uf0a7 A key person could be a partner, stockholder, or key employee.\n  \uf0a7 The key person\u2019s economic value to the business is the potential loss of business income plus the\n    expense of hiring and training a replacement.\n  \uf0a7 Generally, the policy\u2019s elimination period will be from 30 to 90 days, and the benefit period will be from\n    one or two years.\n  \uf0a7 The business is the owner and premium payor of the policy.\n\nTAXATION OF DISABILITY INSURANCE POLICIES\n  \uf0a7 When it comes to disability insurance, the IRS generally taxes the money only once\u2014either when the\n    premiums are paid in or when the benefits are taken out.\n\n  \uf0a7 The taxation of social insurance disability benefits depends on the program and the income of the\n    recipient.\n\n  \uf0a7 Social Security Insurance benefits are partially taxed after one\u2019s total income reaches $25,000 for\n    individuals and $32,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n\n  \uf0a7 In general, workers\u2019 compensation benefits are not subject to state or federal income tax.\n\n  \uf0a7 Premiums are not deductible. The IRS counts premiums as part of taxable income and captures a\n    percentage as income tax.\n  \uf0a7 Benefits are not taxable. Because the IRS collects income tax on money going into the policy, the\n    insured receives benefits from the policy, free of income tax.\n\n  \uf0a7 The premiums paid by employers are tax-deductible as legitimate business expenses.\n  \uf0a7 The group policy benefits the employees, not the employer or the business.\n\n  \uf0a7 The taxation of employee premium dollars and benefits depends on several sets of circumstances\n    (described below).\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f \uf0a7 If the employer pays a participating worker\u2019s disability insurance premium, the benefits are taxable.\n \uf0a7 The employer deducts the premium from taxable income; therefore, the IRS will tax the money coming\n   out of the policy in the form of benefits.\n\n \uf0a7 If an employee pays group premiums on a pre-tax basis through a cafeteria plan, the IRS will tax any\n   benefits as income.\n \uf0a7 The pre-tax contribution avoids taxation when money is paid to the insurer; therefore, the IRS will tax\n   funds when benefits are paid, often when they\u2019re needed the most.\n\n \uf0a7 In some companies, employees pay their disability premiums with after-tax dollars.\n \uf0a7 In such cases, the premiums are not deductible (i.e., they\u2019re after-tax), so the benefits are not taxable.\n\n \uf0a7 If the employee-paid portion of the premium is paid pre-tax, then the entire benefit is taxable.\n \uf0a7 If employees pay their portion of the premium with after-tax dollars, the benefit will be partially taxable\n   and partially tax-free. The degree to which the benefit is income tax-free reflects the percentage of the\n   premium that\u2019s taxable.\n\n \uf0a7 The IRS will only tax the funds once\u2014either on the way in or on the way out.\n\n \uf0a7 For a business overhead expense policy, the premium is a tax-deductible business expense.\n \uf0a7 The benefit is considered a part of taxable revenue.\n \uf0a7 The benefits offset other deductible business expenses.\n[EXAM TIP: When trying to figure out what a BOE policy does NOT cover, the answer is\n\u201cemployer income\u201d or \u201cthe insured\u2019s lost income\u201d or some other similar answer.]\n\n \uf0a7 The company buys disability insurance on each partner or each shareholder in a closed corporation.\n \uf0a7 If the partner or the shareholder is disabled, the company receives the benefit.\n \uf0a7 The taxation works like a standard individual policy. Since the policy holder (the company) pays a\n   premium with after-tax dollars, the policy benefit is income tax-free.\n \uf0a7 The insurance carrier pays the policy holder (the insured company) a lump-sum or periodic benefit,\n   either of which is income-tax-free.\n \uf0a7 Once the company receives the benefit, any further payments or taxation are no longer part of the\n   insurance transaction.\n\n \uf0a7 The taxation of the key-employee policy mirrors the taxation of the individual disability policy.\n \uf0a7 The insured company is protecting itself from the economic impact of a loss.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 .

All rights reserved  \n\fLong-Term Care Riders in Life Insurance Contracts\n  \uf0a7 A person may add LTCI to life insurance as a living benefits rider.\nAccelerated Death Benefit Riders\n  \uf0a7 An accelerated death benefit rider pays out a portion of the life insurance policy\u2019s death benefit\n    upon the diagnosis of a terminal illness or other condition.\n  \uf0a7 Some riders pay a monthly benefit if the insured is confined to a nursing home with the expectation\n    that the insured\u2019s condition will not improve.\n  \uf0a7 Insurers subtract any amounts paid as living benefits from the death proceeds paid to the beneficiary.\n  \uf0a7 The NAIC does NOT include these riders in its model definition of long-term care insurance.\nLong-Term Care Riders\n  \uf0a7 Long-term care riders use part of a life insurance policy\u2019s face amount to pay a monthly benefit to pay\n    the cost of long-term care services.\n  \uf0a7 Insureds qualify for benefits on the same basis as those covered by stand-alone long-term care\n    insurance policies.\nLTC Hybrid (Linked) Plans\n  \uf0a7 Hybrid long-term care plans combine annuity (or life insurance) benefits with a traditional long-\n    term care policy.\n  \uf0a7 The insureds have long-term care benefits guaranteed, or if no care is needed, the other guaranteed\n    contract benefits for themselves or their beneficiaries.\n  \uf0a7 Hybrid products are written using whole life insurance or annuities.\n  \uf0a7 Unlike simple life insurance riders, the potential long-term care benefit is greater than the underlying\n    contract and must be underwritten.\nLong-Term Care (Stand-Alone) Insurance Policy\n  \uf0a7 The accident and health insurance licensing exam focuses on the individual long-term care insurance\n    policy.\n\nQualifying for Long-Term Care\n  \uf0a7 LTCI contracts have two distinct benefit triggers:\n     \u2012 The loss of the physical ability to perform two or more of the six ADLs, or\n     \u2012 The existence of cognitive impairment.\nLoss of the Ability to Perform Two ADLs\n  \uf0a7 The six recognized ADLS are as follows:\n      \u2012 Bathing\n      \u2012 Dressing\n      \u2012 Toileting\n      \u2012 Transferring\n      \u2012 Continence\n      \u2012 Eating\n  \uf0a7 Policies will pay benefits when the insured cannot perform two or more of these tasks without\n    substantial assistance, which the NAIC defines as either:\n      \u2012 \u201cHands-on\u201d (physical) assistance, or\n      \u2012 \u201cStand-by assistance\u201d\nCognitive Impairment\n  \uf0a7 The NAIC Model LTCI regulation defines a \u201ccognitive impairment\u201d as a deficiency in a person\u2019s:\n     \u2012 Short or long-term memory\n     \u2012 Orientation as to person, place, and time\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f      \u2012 Deductive or abstract reasoning, or\n      \u2012 Judgment as it relates to safety awareness\n  \uf0a7 LTCI specifically covers conditions related to organic neurological disorders related to diseases of\n    aging, strokes, and brain injuries.\n\nLong-Term Care Insurance \u2013 Benefit Periods\n  \uf0a7 The LTCI benefit period is the length of time during which claims will be paid.\n  \uf0a7 Policies often require a diagnosis that a person\u2019s impairment is expected to last 90 days or more.\n  \uf0a7 LTCI policies define benefits as a maximum daily amount that\u2019s payable during the benefit period as\n    stated in the contract.\n\u201cPool of Money\u201d Concept\n  \uf0a7 The \u201cpool of money\u201d concept indicates that the policy\u2019s total benefits are limited by the number of\n    available dollars, not a limited number of days.\n      For example, let\u2019s assume that an LTCI contract with a three-year benefit period pays\n      a maximum of $100 per day for institutional care and $50 per day for home care.\n      \u2012 The maximum daily benefit (for institutional care) is $100 per day.\n      \u2012 1,095 days x $100 per day = a $109,500 pool of money.\n      \u2012 This calculation means that the policy will pay the maximum daily benefit for three years. If the\n         insured only uses the policy to pay for home care, the policy will pay only $50 per day for six\n         years ($109,500 = $50 x 2,190 days).\nDaily Benefit Amounts\n  \uf0a7 LTCI includes a daily limit to benefits.\n  \uf0a7 A higher daily limit means a higher annual premium.\n  \uf0a7 Policies often set home care limits between 50% and 80% of the maximum benefit for nursing home\n    care.\n  \uf0a7 LTCI contracts pay daily benefits in one of two ways\u2014as a fixed daily indemnity or based on the\n    actual costs incurred (reimbursement).\n      For example, let\u2019s assume that an insured has a long-term care insurance policy with\n      a stated daily benefit of $200 per day. The insured incurs covered costs of $150\n      during a single 24-hour period.\n      \u2012 If the insured has a policy that pays a daily indemnity, the insured will receive $200.\n      \u2012 If the insured has a policy that reimburses actual costs up to $200, the insured will receive $150.\nElimination Period\n  \uf0a7 LTCI policies generally include an elimination period.\n  \uf0a7 This period helps to restrain the cost of coverage for prospective policyholders.\nWaiver of Premium\n  \uf0a7 The waiver of premium provision suspends premium payments while the insured is receiving\n    benefits.\n  \uf0a7 Some LTC policies offer a lower premium by not including this feature and offering it as an optional\n    rider instead.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fLong-Term Care Insurance \u2013 Optional Provisions\nReturn of Premium Option\n  \uf0a7 The return of premium rider refunds the premiums paid by the policy owner under certain\n    circumstances, such as when a policy lapses or the insured dies without using the policy\u2019s benefits.\nGuarantee of Insurability Option (Rider)\n  \uf0a7 The guaranteed insurability rider is a form of inflation protection.\n  \uf0a7 This rider allows the insured to purchase additional coverage at future intervals based on an assumed\n    rate of inflation.\nRenewability Provisions\n  \uf0a7 All long-term care policies must be issued as at least guaranteed renewable.\n  \uf0a7 An insurance company may only cancel an LTCI policy because the policyholder fails to pay the\n    premium.\nNon-Forfeiture Options\n  \uf0a7 Non-forfeiture benefits allow the insured to receive some value from the plan if the policy lapses due\n    to the non-payment of premium.\n  \uf0a7 This option is typically available in one of the following three different forms:\n      \u2012 A reduced paid-up policy\n      \u2012 Access to the same daily benefit for a shortened period\n      \u2012 A specified dollar amount that\u2019s refunded to the insured\nAutomatic Inflation Rider (AIR)\n  \uf0a7 The automatic inflation rider annually increases the initial daily benefit of a long-term care\n    insurance policy, typically at a rate of 5% compounded per year.\n\nPolicy Exclusions\n  \uf0a7 Exclusions that are found in a long-term care policy include war, treatment for drug or alcohol abuse,\n    intentionally self-inflicted injury, attempted suicide, nervous disorders, mental illnesses, institutional\n    care received outside the U.S., or losses covered by Workers\u2019 Compensation.\n\nApplication and Underwriting\nMarketing Long-Term Care Coverage\n  \uf0a7 Insurers that market LTC insurance must establish marketing procedures to:\n      \u2012 Ensure its agents make fair and adequate policy comparisons\n      \u2012 Avoid selling excessive insurance; and\n      \u2012 Advise buyers that the policy may not cover all long-term care costs.\n  \uf0a7 Insurers must waive any pre-existing condition limitations on replacement LTCI policies.\nDisclosures\n  \uf0a7 Disclosures that are typically required at the time of sale include:\n      \u2012 Outline of Coverage\n      \u2012 LTCI Shopper\u2019s Guide\n      \u2012 Personal Worksheet\n      \u2012 Rating Practices\n  \uf0a7 To prevent an unintentional lapse, an applicant may designate a third party to receive any notice of a\n    policy lapse or termination due to non-payment of premium.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fUnderwriting\n  \uf0a7 Generally, a person\u2019s eligibility to purchase LTCI coverage is similar to her ability to buy other types\n    of health insurance plans, such as individual or group disability coverage.\n  \uf0a7 Post-claims underwriting is the act of approving all applicants and only underwriting a risk exposure\n    when a claim is filed.\n  \uf0a7 The process results in an insurer denying claims based on the insured\u2019s health or for other reasons.\n  \uf0a7 This underwriting approach is a prohibited and unfair trade practice.\nPre-Existing Conditions\n  \uf0a7 Most long-term care policies define a pre-existing condition as one for which medical advice or\n    treatment was recommended or received within the six months preceding the effective date.\n  \uf0a7 Long-term care policies may exclude losses due to a pre-existing condition for up to 6 months\n    following the effective date of coverage.\nPremium\n  \uf0a7 Long-term care policy premiums depend on several factors, such as age, health conditions, benefit\n    periods, and level of care.\n\nAssociation and Group Long-Term Care Insurance\nAssociation (Affinity Group) LTCI\n  \uf0a7 A sponsoring association provides a marketing channel and addresses member questions.\n  \uf0a7 Associations must provide objective information regarding endorsed long-term care insurance policies\n    or certificates.\n  \uf0a7 The association must disclose all of the compensation it receives from the endorsement or sale of\n    insurance to its members.\n  \uf0a7 It must also disclose the process for selecting the insurance program.\nEmployer Group Insurance\n  \uf0a7 Employers often offer LTCI as a voluntary, employee-paid benefit.\n  \uf0a7 Policies often feature simplified underwriting and discounted premiums.\n  \uf0a7 Plans allow access to a more extended family group, including parents and siblings.\n  \uf0a7 Large employers may also offer LTCI as a true group benefit with a limited amount of guaranteed\n    issue coverage for employees.\n\nTax Considerations\n  \uf0a7 Premiums that are paid on an individual long-term care policy are not tax-deductible.\n  \uf0a7 LTCI benefits are not taxable to the extent that they reimburse the insured for his expenses.\n  \uf0a7 When LTC insurance plans that pay benefits on an indemnity basis and pay the insured more than the\n    insured spent, the insured could be taxed unless the insured\u2019s long-term care policy is a tax-qualified\n    long-term care contract.\n  \uf0a7 Tax qualified plans must satisfy specific criteria, and they may be individual or group insurance\n    contracts.\n  \uf0a7 Expenses that are paid for long-term care services, including premiums paid for qualified plans, are\n    treated as any other medical expense. They\u2019re deductible in combination with other medical expenses\n    to the extent that they exceed 7.5% of an individual\u2019s adjusted gross income.\n  \uf0a7 In addition, HIPAA exempts qualified policy benefits in excess of actual expenses from income tax up\n    to a daily limit.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fQualified Long-Term Care Policies\n  \uf0a7 To be designated as tax-qualified, a long-term care insurance policy must meet the following criteria:\n     \u2012 The policy cannot pay expenses that are reimbursable under Medicare.\n     \u2012 The benefit trigger must be either the loss of a person\u2019s ability to perform two of the six ADLs or\n        the existence of a severe cognitive impairment.\n     \u2012 The policy is at least guaranteed renewable.\n     \u2012 The policy doesn\u2019t include a cash surrender value.\n     \u2012 The policy only provides long-term care services.\n     \u2012 The policy has a 30-day fee-look period.\n     \u2012 The policy requires all claims to be based on a medical diagnosis of disability lasting at least 90\n        days.\n     \u2012 When an insured files a claim, the policy requires that a medical professional devise a written\n        plan of care.\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, and LTCI\n  \uf0a7 Medicare, Medicaid, and long-term care insurance address senior citizens\u2019 needs, but the role of each\n    policy is distinct and not interchangeable. The following section offers a quick comparison of these\n    three mechanisms.\nMedicare\n  \uf0a7 Medicare is medical insurance in the traditional sense for individuals who are the age of 65 and older,\n    along with certain individuals who suffer from a severe disability. It provides treatment to acute and\n    chronic illnesses to cure acute conditions or treat chronic diseases so as to mitigate them.\nMedicaid\n  \uf0a7 Medicaid is a means-tested, public program that was established to provide medical and supportive\n    services to individuals who are at or below the poverty line. The funding comes from both the federal\n    government and state budgets. Each state administers its own program.\n  \uf0a7 Medicaid services overlap with both Medicare and long-term insurance. Low-income individuals who\n    are the age of 65 and older can qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid to cover their medical costs\n    more fully. Senior citizens who lack assets can be eligible for long-term services and supports\n    (LTSS) paid by Medicaid.\n  \uf0a7 Originally, Medicaid paid for LTSS delivered in nursing homes. However, given the increasing costs\n    of such care, the federal government granted states the authority to devise alternative programs that\n    deliver such services using alternative avenues, such as in-home care. Individuals can qualify for\n    Medicaid funding for LTSS only when their countable assets (other than their residence and some\n    other such property) are depleted. At times, more affluent individuals may attempt to qualify for\n    Medicaid while sheltering assets from liquidation by transferring property to relatives. The states\n    consider all asset transfers over the five years before any application for Medicaid benefits. If an\n    insured transfers assets to family members, the medical assistance administrators will delay the\n    insured\u2019s access to public funding for long-term services and support.\nLong-Term Care Insurance\n  \uf0a7 Long-term care insurance (LTCI) policies are the private alternative to the public funding of long-\n    term services and supports (LTSS). The government has recognized its value as the cost of LTSS\n    continues to burden the government\u2019s capacity to fund it. To encourage individuals to purchase\n    private policies, the government established the ability of each state to create a long-term care\n    partnership program.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f    Long-Term Care Partnership Programs\n      \uf0a7 The Long-Term Care Partnership Program is a federally supported, state-operated initiative that\n        allows individuals who purchase a qualified long-term care coverage to protect a portion of those\n        assets they would otherwise need to spend before qualifying for Medicaid.\n      \uf0a7 Partnership policy requirements vary by state, but all must be tax-qualified and provide inflation\n        protection. All policies must also meet consumer disclosure requirements.\n\u2022\n\n          Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved"

In accordance with the NAIC Model, there are\n    23 uniform provisions for use in insurance contracts\u201412 uniform mandatory provisions and 11\n    uniform optional provisions.\n  \uf0a7 Insurance companies may substitute their own language with approval from their various state\n    regulators.\n  \uf0a7 Substitute language can be no less favorable to the insured. This uniform language requirement helps\n    assure a consistent understanding of policy terms and provisions.\n\nTHE 12 REQUIRED (MANDATORY) UNIFORM\nPROVISIONS\n The Entire Contract Clause\n  \uf0a7 In a health insurance policy, the entire contract clause defines the entire contract as the policy, the\n    insured\u2019s application, and any papers that are attached to the policy document.\n  \uf0a7 Nothing outside of the contract (as described above) can be considered part of the contract.\n  \uf0a7 It assures the policy owner that no changes will be made without the policy holder\u2019s written consent.\n    [EXAM TIP: Remember WYSIWYG. \u201cWhat you see is what you get!\u201d]\n\n Time Limit on Certain Defenses (Incontestability)\n  \uf0a7 The time limit on certain defenses provision declares the policy to be incontestable after it has been\n    in force for three years.\n  \uf0a7 Fraud on a health insurance application is always grounds for termination unless the policy is\n    guaranteed renewable or non-cancellable.\n  \uf0a7 A number of states reduced the time limit on certain defenses to two years.\n    [EXAM TIP: Assume a time limit of three years unless the test references state law or integrates\n    law and general questions. In other cases, check the law, and assume three years if no specific\n    reference is given.]\n\n Grace Period\n  \uf0a7 Insurers must include a grace period following the premium due date, during which time the insured\n    may make the delayed premium payment without penalty or loss of coverage. The specified minimum\n    grace periods are:\n      \u2012 Seven days for policies with weekly premium payments (i.e., industrial policies)\n      \u2012 10 days for policies with premiums payable monthly, and\n      \u2012 31 days for other policies\n Reinstatement\n  \uf0a7 The reinstatement provision restricts reinstatement payments to premiums that are due within the\n    previous 60 days.\n  \uf0a7 Reinstatement is automatic if the insurer accepts the delinquent premium and doesn\u2019t require an\n    application.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 .

All rights reserved  \n\f Illegal Occupation\n  \uf0a7 This clause allows insurers to deny claims if an insured is injured while committing an illegal act or\n    engaging in a felonious occupation.\n  \uf0a7 If an insurer discovers the illegal occupation after paying the claim, the company will attempt to\n    recover the payment.\n Intoxicants and Narcotics\n  \uf0a7 This clause relieves the insurance carrier of liability for losses while the insured was under the\n    influence of non-prescribed drugs or alcohol when the loss occurred.\n\nADDITIONAL NECESSARY POLICY PROVISIONS\n  \uf0a7 These provisions are necessary, but the language is not regulated, and the uniform provisions law\n    doesn\u2019t mandate their placement.\n\nFREE-LOOK (RIGHT TO EXAMINE CLAUSE)\n  \uf0a7 The most common provision provides the insured with 10 days to examine the policy from the\n    policy\u2019s delivery date.\n  \uf0a7 If the insured decides to return the policy during the free-look period, the insured will receive a full\n    premium refund.\n\nINSURING CLAUSE\n  \uf0a7 The insuring clause is the part of the health insurance policy that primarily states:\n     \u2012 The benefits provided and\n     \u2012 The circumstances under which they\u2019re payable\n  \uf0a7 The clause defines the insurance company\u2019s promise to pay benefits.\n\nCONSIDERATION CLAUSE\n  \uf0a7 The consideration clause defines the insured\u2019s consideration.\n  \uf0a7 The policy owner\u2019s consideration consists of the following two elements:\n     \u2012 The premium paid, and\n     \u2012 The statements (legal representations) that are made on the health insurance application\n\nWAIVER OF PREMIUM\n  \uf0a7 The waiver of premium provision waives the payment of premiums after the insured has been totally\n    disabled for the specified period (as stipulated in the policy).\n\nMILITARY SUSPENSE PROVISION\n  \uf0a7 This provision temporarily suspends coverage for an insured who\u2019s called up to activity duty, but\n    coverage resumes when the period of service ends.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fRENEWABILITY PROVISIONS\n  \uf0a7 Health insurance policies have one of the various renewability clauses that define the circumstances\n    under which an insurer may change or terminate an existing contract.\n  \uf0a7 The insured can cancel the policy at any time.\n\nNON-CANCELLABLE POLICIES\n  \uf0a7 A non-cancellable policy is one that cannot be canceled as long as the policy owner pays the\n    premium.\n  \uf0a7 Some contracts refer to this type of policy as \u201cnon-cancellable and guaranteed renewable.\u201d\n  \uf0a7 The insurer can neither modify the policy\u2019s terms nor increase the premium.\n  \uf0a7 This type of renewal provision is the most advantageous renewal provision for a policy holder but is\n    also the most expensive.\n\nGUARANTEED RENEWABLE POLICIES\n  \uf0a7 Insurers cannot terminate a guaranteed renewable policy as long as the premium is paid.\n  \uf0a7 The insurer cannot change policy benefits, conditions, or terms in any way.\n  \uf0a7 The insurer is allowed to increase premiums on a class basis (not on a specific policy) in response to a\n    general change in the class\u2019s aggregate risk level.\n    For example, a disability income insurer can raise premiums on all policies that are\n    issued to nurses and other gray collar professionals in response to an increase in back\n    injuries and the rise of new infectious diseases. It cannot increase the premiums paid by a\n    specific nurse because of chronic back problems.\n\nCONDITIONALLY RENEWABLE POLICIES\n  \uf0a7 An insurer may decide not to renew a conditionally renewable policy under certain conditions that\n    are stated in the policy.\n  \uf0a7 These conditions are typically related to the insured reaching a certain age or losing gainful\n    employment.\n  \uf0a7 The stated reasons that allow an insurer to terminate coverage are based on general conditions, not\n    individual insurability.\n  \uf0a7 Carriers can also increase policy premiums at renewal on a class basis only.\n\nOPTIONALLY RENEWABLE POLICIES (RENEWABLE\nAT COMPANY\u2019S OPTION)\n  \uf0a7 The optionally renewal policy offers no guarantee of continuance beyond the end of the current\n    policy renewal period.\n  \uf0a7 The insurer also has the option to increase the premiums for any policy class (not an individual\n    policy).\n\nNON-RENEWABLE POLICIES\n  \uf0a7 Non-renewable policies are typically used to meet short-term health insurance needs.\n  \uf0a7 These policies remain in force for one year or less.\n  \uf0a7 Policy holders use them to bridge anticipated coverage gaps.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fPERIOD OF TIME\n  \uf0a7 These policies, such as \u201cshort-term major medical\u201d plans\u2014also referred to as term policies\u2014are only\n    renewable for a stipulated term (e.g., six months) or period.\n\nCANCELLABLE POLICIES\n  \uf0a7 Either the insured or insurer may cancel coverage.\n  \uf0a7 The renewability provision allows the insurer to cancel this type of policy with a five-day written\n    notice and the return of any unearned premiums.\n  \uf0a7 An insurer may cancel an individual policy if the insured files too many claims in a policy period.\n  \uf0a7 Most states don\u2019t allow the issuance of cancellable health insurance policies.\n\nPOLICY EXCLUSIONS, LIMITS, AND RESTRICTIONS\n  \uf0a7 Health insurance policies frequently cite a number of exclusions or conditions that are not covered,\n    such as:\n      \u2012 Injuries due to war or an act of war\n      \u2012 Injuries sustained while serving in the armed services\n      \u2012 Self-inflicted injuries, including suicide\n      \u2012 Injuries while the insured is piloting an aircraft or serving as a crew member\n      \u2012 Non-commercial air travel\n      \u2012 Foreign travel, especially extended stays overseas or foreign residence\n      \u2012 Losses resulting from riots, or the use of drugs or narcotics\n      \u2012 Injuries sustained while attempting or committing a felony\n      \u2012 Losses covered by Workers\u2019 Compensation\n      \u2012 Care paid by the Veterans Administration (VA)\n      \u2012 Cosmetic surgery, experimental surgery, and vision correction\n\nPROBATIONARY PERIOD\n  \uf0a7 The probationary period is a one-time 30-day event that becomes effective when the policy is\n    issued.\n  \uf0a7 It excludes losses due to illness during the first days of a new policy, asserting the infection occurred\n    before coverage began, even if symptoms did not appear until after coverage began.\n  \uf0a7 Coverage for accidents is not excluded.\n\nPRE-EXISTING CONDITION PROVISIONS\n  \uf0a7 The preexisting condition provision states that a health insurance policy will not cover any health\n    condition that existed during the period immediately before the policy became effective. Most often,\n    this provision applies to conditions that are not disclosed in an insurance application.\n  \uf0a7 This provision is essential for group insurance or other contracts with simplified underwriting or none\n    at all.\n  \uf0a7 This provision helps to protect an insurer regardless of whether an applicant knows he\u2019s ill.\n  \uf0a7 This provision doesn\u2019t typically apply to disclosed preexisting conditions. (See \u201cimpairment rider\u201d\n    below.)\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fIMPAIRMENT (WAIVER FOR IMPAIRMENT) RIDER\n  \uf0a7 An impairment rider is also referred to as an exclusion rider, coverage waiver, or a waiver of\n    disability.\n  \uf0a7 Impairment riders allow an insurer to restrict coverage for an illness or injury that\u2019s disclosed on an\n    application for the life of the contract.\n  \uf0a7 Since the rider allows the insurer to exclude a significant source of greater than average risk, the\n    insurance carrier can often provide coverage at the standard premium.\n  \uf0a7 If an impairment rider is attached to a policy, its restrictions or limitations must be explained to the\n    policy owner at the time of delivery. Generally, the policy owner must sign a statement that he\u2019s\n    aware of and understands the effects and limitations of this type of rider.\n\nADDITIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY\nPROVISIONS\nOWNER\u2019S RIGHTS PROVISION\n  \uf0a7 This provision states that the policy holder is entitled to all of the ownership rights under the health\n    insurance contract.\n\nASSIGNMENT PROVISION\n  \uf0a7 Unlike life insurance, policy owners don\u2019t have an unlimited ability to transfer their rights because\n    health insurance is a personal contract.\n  \uf0a7 They can assign certain benefits to providers for direct payment of expenses.\n\nBENEFICIARY PROVISION\n  \uf0a7 When health insurance includes a death benefit, the Required Uniform Mandatory Provisions include\n    a \u201cchange of beneficiary\u201d provision.\n  \uf0a7 This provision may require detailed information that\u2019s most commonly associated with life insurance.\n Beneficiary Types\n  \uf0a7 Insurance gives the insured the ability to deliver benefits directly to named individuals, groups, or\n    institutions without going through the probate process.\n  \uf0a7 If no beneficiary is named, any death benefit is included in the insured\u2019s estate.\n       \u2012 Individual beneficiaries: In this case, the insured names one or more specific individuals to\n          receive a death benefit.\n       \u2012 Beneficiary Class: A beneficiary class or class designation defines beneficiaries by describing\n          them rather than naming them.\n Order of Succession\n  \uf0a7 Primary beneficiaries: These beneficiaries receive all of the benefits at the insured\u2019s death.\n  \uf0a7 Secondary (contingent) beneficiaries: These beneficiaries only receive benefits if all of the primary\n    beneficiaries have predeceased the insured. They\u2019re second in line.\n  \uf0a7 Tertiary beneficiaries: These beneficiaries only receive benefits if both the primary and secondary\n    beneficiaries all die before the insured.\n  \uf0a7 When there are no named beneficiaries left, the death benefit goes to the insured\u2019s estate\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fMODES OF PREMIUM PAYMENT PROVISION\n  \uf0a7 The provision governing the premium mode allows the policy holder to select the frequency of their\n    policy premiums, such as:\n      \u2012 Monthly\n      \u2012 Quarterly\n      \u2012 Semiannually, or\n      \u2012 Annually\n  \uf0a7 The annual mode is the least expensive mode of premium, while the monthly premium is the most\n    costly.\n  \uf0a7 A \u201csingle-premium\u201d is not an option for health insurance policies.\n\nREDUCTIONS IN COVERAGE\n  \uf0a7 The reductions in coverage provision states that health insurance policies don\u2019t reduce coverage\n    amounts following a loss.\n\nBENEFIT PAYMENT PROVISION\n  \uf0a7 The benefit payment provision states how benefits will be paid.\n  \uf0a7 The benefit payment provision will differ depending on the policy involved.\n\nNO LOSS / NO GAIN PROVISION\n  \uf0a7 This provision states that the purpose of insurance is primarily to \u201cindemnify\u201d a person for a loss.\n\nRESTORATION OF BENEFITS PROVISION\n  \uf0a7 The restoration of benefits provision states that the amount paid out for a loss doesn\u2019t reduce the\n    total available benefits for future claims. Some policies include this provision automatically, while\n    others offer it as an optional rider. Some policies condition the restoration with a requirement to be\n    claim-free for a specific period following a covered loss.\n\nCOORDINATION OF BENEFITS\n  \uf0a7 The coordination of benefits provision is found in group insurance, but it also applies to social\n    insurance programs (e.g., Medicare).\n  \uf0a7 The provision limits the total amount of payments from all insurers that cover the claim to no more\n    than the total cost of care (e.g., avoids duplication of benefits).\n  \uf0a7 The COB provision also establishes which plan is primary and must pay all of the benefits specified\n    by the contract. Once the primary insurance plan pays benefits as if it were the only available\n    coverage, the secondary provider is liable for the remaining costs.\n  \uf0a7 Employer-sponsored group insurance is the primary coverage for workers who are the age of 65 or\n    older if the employer is a \u201cCOBRA group\u201d of 20 or more employees.\n  \uf0a7 If a group has fewer than 20 employees, Medicare is the primary insurer.\n  \uf0a7 Medicare is always the primary coverage for any person with an individual policy or group retiree\n    medical insurance.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 .

      "content": "THE PURPOSE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF\nUNDERWRITING INSURANCE\n   \uf0a7 The underwriting process determines an insurer\u2019s ability to insure a loss exposure by reviewing and\n     evaluating an applicant\u2019s information and applying the carrier\u2019s guidelines for insurability.\n   \uf0a7 Once underwriters determine whether a loss exposure is insurable, they determine the required\n     premium rate.\n\n Risk Factors in Health Insurance\n   \uf0a7 The risk factors for life and health insurance are similar, but health insurers deal with a broader range\n     of risks.\n Insurable Interest\n   \uf0a7 Insurable interest is a prerequisite for issuing a health policy.\n   \uf0a7 It exists if the applicant will suffer a loss in the event the insured incurs medical expenses or becomes\n     disabled.\n Physical Condition and Health History\n   \uf0a7 An applicant\u2019s physical condition, which refers to his health and body build, is of primary importance\n     when evaluating health risks.\n   \uf0a7 Typically, an insurer is just as concerned with an applicant\u2019s health history as it is with his current\n     health. An applicant\u2019s medical history can help predict future healthcare needs, as can his family\u2019s\n     health history.\n Moral Hazards\n   \uf0a7 Applicants\u2019 habits or lifestyles also indicate the potential of additional risks for the insurer. These\n     factors are referred to as moral hazards. Examples include excessive drinking or drug use. Other signs\n     of moral hazard can be a low credit rating or dishonest business practices.\n Occupation and Hobbies\n   \uf0a7 There\u2019s a direct correlation between a person\u2019s job and the probability and severity of a disabling\n     injury occurring.\n   \uf0a7 If an applicant has two jobs, the insurance company will base the benefits and the premiums on the\n     more hazardous one.\n   \uf0a7 An applicant\u2019s hobbies and personal activities can also affect whether a carrier covers a proposed\n     insured. Activities such as mountain climbing or having a license to pilot small planes can affect\n     insurability or, at best, increase the cost of coverage.\n   \uf0a7 Hobbies are also referred to as avocations.\n Age and Sex\n   \uf0a7 An insured\u2019s age and sex (gender) are underwriting factors.\n      \u2012 Generally, older applicants are more significant risks.\n      \u2012 Women have higher rates of disability at younger ages, but insurers CANNOT reject prospective\n          insureds based on gender.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f Classification of Risk Exposures (Applicants)\n   \uf0a7 Once underwriters review an applicant\u2019s information, they will determine that applicant\u2019s level of risk\n     or risk classification.\n   \uf0a7 There are three classifications of those that are insurable. Individuals who are not insurable are\n     classified as declined.\n Preferred Risk\n   \uf0a7 A preferred risk exceeds an insurer\u2019s risk requirements.\n   \uf0a7 Companies issue preferred risk policies with reduced premiums with the expectation of better (lower)\n     than average morbidity experience.\n Standard Risk\n   \uf0a7 Individuals who are assigned a standard risk classification meet the same conditions as the tabular\n     risks on which the insurer\u2019s premium rates are based.\n   \uf0a7 A standard risk is an average risk.\n Substandard (Rated) Risk\n   \uf0a7 A substandard risk is an individual who fails to meet the insurer\u2019s standard or average risk guidelines.\n   \uf0a7 Insuring the substandard application involves taking on a greater-than-average risk of loss.\n   \uf0a7 The terms \u201crated policy\u201d and \u201crated premium\u201d refer to a substandard policy with a higher-than-\n     average (rated-up) premium.\n\nPREMIUM CALCULATIONS\n General Insurance Premium Concepts\n Premium\n   \uf0a7 Premium is the initial payment and subsequent periodic payments required to keep a policy in force.\n Premium Mode\n   \uf0a7 The mode refers to the frequency of premium payments.\n   \uf0a7 Premiums can be paid quarterly, semiannually, or monthly.\n   \uf0a7 The higher the frequency of payments, the more the policy will cost the insured in total.\n Earned Premium\n   \uf0a7 Earned premium is a pro-rated amount of a paid premium that an insurer has \u201cearned\u201d by providing\n     coverage.\n Unearned Premium\n   \uf0a7 Unearned premium represents the portion of paid premiums that has yet to be \u201cearned\u201d because it\u2019s\n     allocated to cover the remaining portion of the policy term.\n Policy Term\n   \uf0a7 This is the period during which a policy remains in existence when a premium is paid.\n Policy Fee\n   \uf0a7 The policy fee is a small transaction fee that\u2019s charged by some insurers for the first or subsequent\n     years of an insurance policy, in addition to the regular premium.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f Primary Health Insurance Premium Factors\n   \uf0a7 Health insurance premiums = morbidity \u2013 interest + expenses\n Morbidity\n   \uf0a7 Morbidity Tables show the average number of persons within a specific group that can be expected to\n     become disabled within a given year at a given age.\n Interest\n   \uf0a7 Insurance companies invest the premiums they receive, and the interest they earn is one way they can\n     lower premium rates.\n Expenses\n   \uf0a7 The expense factor is also referred to as the loading charge or factor.\n   \uf0a7 The expense factor is derived from operating expenses.\n   \uf0a7 Expenses include commissions, other wages, profits, and the regulatory requirement to set aside\n     reserves for future claims.\n\n Secondary Factors That Influence Premiums\n Benefits\n   \uf0a7 The greater the benefits, the higher the premium.\n\n Elements That Influence Morbidity Calculations\n Claims Experience\n   \uf0a7 To set realistic premium rates, underwriters estimate future claims based on past claims experience.\n   \uf0a7 When determining the appropriate coverage, the insurer\u2019s underwriters will use the group\u2019s\n     experience rating.\n Age and Sex of the Insured\n   \uf0a7 Health insurance claims costs tend to increase as the age of the insured increases.\n   \uf0a7 An insured\u2019s sex will influence premiums as well.\n Occupation and Hobbies\n   \uf0a7 An insured\u2019s occupation will impact rates since more hazardous occupations carry more risk.\n Community Ratings\n   \uf0a7 Smaller group health plans use a community rating method, which applies the identical premium rate\n     structure for all subscribers in a community.\n   \uf0a7 Insurers base premiums on their overall claims experience and healthcare costs in a geographical area.\n\nPARTIES INVOLVED IN UNDERWRITING\n The Producer (Agent)\n   \uf0a7 Producers perform field underwriting. This is the initial step in the underwriting process, in which\n     they gather necessary underwriting information and distribute required disclosures to the buyer.\n   \uf0a7 A field underwriter (producer) solicits appointments, completes, and submits applications, and\n     collects premiums.\n   \uf0a7 The producer does NOT issue the policy.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f Agent Responsibility\n   \uf0a7 Agents have a fiduciary responsibility to consumers during insurance transactions.\n   \uf0a7 Agents act in a fiduciary capacity for the insurers when collecting premiums.\n   \uf0a7 Agents complete the following essential tasks:\n      \u2012 Engaging in proper solicitation\n      \u2012 Completing the application properly\n      \u2012 Obtaining appropriate signatures\n      \u2012 Collecting the initial premium, and\n      \u2012 Issuing the correct premium receipt\n Proper Solicitation\n   \uf0a7 Agents have a duty to solicit profitable applications.\n   \uf0a7 Agents are responsible for following the highest professional standard when working with consumers.\n   \uf0a7 Agents must obtain authorization forms to gather third-party investigative reports.\n   \uf0a7 Where required, agents must obtain signed forms to verify that applicants received necessary\n     disclosures.\n Unfair Discrimination\n   \uf0a7 No insurer may engage in unfair discrimination based on any protected category such as sexual\n     orientation, religious preference, or geographical location.\n\n The Applicant\n   \uf0a7 The applicant is the person who\u2019s requesting the insurance.\n   \uf0a7 Typically, the applicant is also the proposed insured.\n\n The Proposed Insured\n   \uf0a7 The proposed insured is the person who\u2019s obtaining the insurance.\n   \uf0a7 The policy holder retains all of the rights and options that are conferred by the policy. The policy\n     holder is also typically the payor.\n\n The Underwriter\n   \uf0a7 An underwriter reviews insurance applications, classifies the degree of risk, and determines\n     insurability and premium rate.\n\nTHE UNDERWRITING (APPLICATION) PROCESS\n   \uf0a7 The most common underwriting information sources include the following:\n       \u2012 The application\n       \u2012 The medical report\n       \u2012 An attending physician\u2019s statement\n       \u2012 The Medical Information Bureau\n       \u2012 Special questionnaires\n       \u2012 Inspection reports, and\n       \u2012 Credit reports\n   \uf0a7 For some smaller policies, insurance carriers use a non-medical application that requires no additional\n     information other than the application.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fThe Application\n  \uf0a7 The principal source of underwriting information is the application.\n  \uf0a7 It\u2019s the agent\u2019s responsibility to ensure that an applicant\u2019s answers are both thorough and accurately\n    recorded.\n  \uf0a7 There are three essential parts to a typical health insurance application:\n       \u2012 Part I: General Applicant Information\n       \u2012 Part II: Medical and Health History, and\n       \u2012 Part III: The Agent\u2019s Report or Statement\nPart I \u2013 General Applicant Information\n  \uf0a7 Part I of the application asks general questions about the proposed insured.\n  \uf0a7 Part I also describes details about the requested coverage, including policy type, benefit amount,\n    beneficiary name(s), existing insurance, and any other needed information.\n  \uf0a7 It also inquires as to whether the proposed insured uses tobacco.\nPart II \u2013 Medical and Health History\n  \uf0a7 Part II asks about the proposed insured\u2019s health and health history, as well as the health history of the\n    proposed insured\u2019s family.\n  \uf0a7 The insurer may require a medical exam.\n  \uf0a7 The prospective insured may be required to provide a blood test or urine specimen.\n  \uf0a7 Any exams and lab work are done at the insurer\u2019s expense.\nPart III \u2013 The Agent's Report (or Statement)\n  \uf0a7 Part III is referred to as the agent\u2019s report or agent\u2019s statement.\n  \uf0a7 The agent\u2019s report includes personal observations about the proposed insured.\n  \uf0a7 The agent can provide additional information about the applicant\u2019s financial condition and character.\n  \uf0a7 If a new policy replaces an existing one, states require agents to follow specific procedures to protect\n    consumer rights.\n\nCompleting the Application\n  \uf0a7 If an agent fails to ensure that an application is completed fully and accurately, several consequences\n    may follow:\n       \u2012 Several delays will follow\n       \u2012 The applicant may also decide to do business elsewhere\n       \u2012 The insurance company will return the application to the agent if it\u2019s incomplete.\n  \uf0a7 Applicant answers to application questions are considered representations.\n  \uf0a7 Representations are statements that are made with the belief that they\u2019re substantially true to the best\n    of the applicant\u2019s knowledge.\n  \uf0a7 Misrepresentations are considered fraudulent only when they\u2019re material to the risk and made with\n    fraudulent intent.\nApplication Signatures\n  \uf0a7 All insurers require the producer to sign the application. If not, it will not be underwritten.\n  \uf0a7 Each application also requires the signatures of the proposed adult insured and the policy owner (if\n    different from the insured).\n  \uf0a7 Where required by state law, the agent also must sign a form attesting that a disclosure statement has\n    been given to the applicant.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  \uf0a7 Additionally, a form that authorizes the insurance company to obtain investigative consumer reports\n    or medical information from investigative agencies, physicians, hospitals, or other sources generally\n    must be signed by the proposed insured with the agent as a witness.\nMinor Applicants and Proposed Insureds\n  \uf0a7 In most states, any person who\u2019s under the age of 18 is considered a minor. This age is also referred to\n    as the age of majority.\n  \uf0a7 Companies require the signature of a parent or guardian if the proposed insured is under the age of 18.\nChanges To the Application\n  \uf0a7 If applicants make mistakes when completing applications, they can have their agent correct the\n    information, but they must initial the correction.\n  \uf0a7 When attached to the insurance policy, the application becomes a part of a legal contract.\n\nAdditional Laws, Disclosures, and Sources of Underwriting Information\n  \uf0a7 Insurers must obtain the applicant\u2019s permission to legally receive necessary additional information\n    from third-party sources.\nThe Medical Report\n  \uf0a7 For policies that provide substantial benefits, a medical report may be needed to provide further\n    underwriting information.\n  \uf0a7 Medical reports may come from the insured\u2019s physician, or an examination done during the\n    application process.\nAttending Physician\u2019s Statement\n  \uf0a7 Underwriters may request an attending physician\u2019s statement (APS) from the applicant\u2019s physician if\n    the application\u2019s medical section raises questions about a particular medical condition.\n  \uf0a7 The statement will provide details about the medical condition in question.\n  \uf0a7 The completed report is forwarded to the insurer, where its medical staff reviews the information.\nThe Medical Information Bureau (MIB Group)\n  \uf0a7 The Medical Information Bureau (MIB) is another source of information about an applicant\u2019s medical\n    history.\n  \uf0a7 The MIB is a clearinghouse of health information that\u2019s supplied by insurers from previous applications.\n  \uf0a7 The MIB helps to detect any undisclosed adverse health conditions.\n  \uf0a7 The MIB report will identify insurance in force with other carriers and will disclose lifestyle habits\n    (e.g., drug use).\n  \uf0a7 The MIB\u2019s purpose is to help expose fraud cases and unintentional acts of misrepresentation or\n    concealment.\n  \uf0a7 An MIB report by itself cannot be the basis for declining an application; instead, it\u2019s the basis for\n    initiating an investigation.\n  \uf0a7 The MIB may release information to the proposed insured\u2019s physician.\nPrivacy Notice\n  \uf0a7 According to the HIPAA statute\u2019s privacy rule, when an agent submits an application that contains\n    personally identifiable health information, the agent is responsible for providing the applicant with\n    privacy notices.\n  \uf0a7 Producers must also secure HIV consent forms to conduct applicant blood tests, despite the fact that\n    they may be part of the standard underwriting process.\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fUSA PATRIOT Act\n  \uf0a7 The USA PATRIOT Act requires insurance companies to establish formal anti-money laundering\n    programs.\nSpecial Questionnaires\n  \uf0a7 Special questionnaires gather more detailed information about a non-medical aspect of the applicant\u2019s\n    life, such as avocations (e.g., mountain climbing).\nInspection Reports\n  \uf0a7 Inspection reports provide a picture of an applicant\u2019s general character and reputation, mode of\n    living, finances, and any exposure to abnormal hazards.\n  \uf0a7 Investigators or inspectors may interview employees, neighbors, and associates of the applicant, as\n    well as the applicant himself.\n  \uf0a7 It may also include a credit report.\nCredit Reports\n  \uf0a7 Since some applicants may be poor credit risks, credit reports from the credit bureaus are a valuable\n    underwriting tool.\n  \uf0a7 Applicants with questionable credit ratings can cause an insurance company to lose money by\n    allowing their policies to lapse shortly after they\u2019re issued.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) of 1970\n  \uf0a7 The FCRA protects the rights of consumers for whom a credit report is requested.\n  \uf0a7 The FCRA established procedures for collecting and disseminating consumer credit information.\n  \uf0a7 Let\u2019s assume that an insurer declines a consumer due to poor credit. In this case, the FCRA requires\n    the insurer to notify the applicant that a copy of the credit report is available through the appropriate\n    credit bureau.\nInformation and Privacy Protection Act\n  \uf0a7 According to the Information and Privacy Protection Act, insurers must conform to state and federal\n    laws regarding the dissemination of a consumer\u2019s private information.\n\nThe Initial Premium and Premium Receipts\n  \uf0a7 The nature of a receipt is that it denotes the payment of funds for goods or services. In this case, it\n    denotes the good faith payment of an initial premium in return for the company\u2019s promise to pay.\n    Premium receipts are important because they can establish a person\u2019s protection under the terms of a\n    policy before the insurer issues the contract.\nPremiums Paid with the Application\n  \uf0a7 The proposed insured benefits from paying the initial premium with the application. Insurance\n    protection becomes effective immediately; however, it comes with significant limitations.\n  \uf0a7 If the first premium is not paid with the application, the policy will not become effective until the\n    initial premium is collected.\n  \uf0a7 An application without a premium is referred to as a trial application.\n  \uf0a7 When an agent collects a premium with an application, the agent must give the applicant a premium\n    receipt.\n  \uf0a7 The type of receipt determines when coverage is effective.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\fPremium Receipts\n  \uf0a7 Applicants who pay a premium with the application are entitled to a premium receipt.\n  \uf0a7 Two types of receipts exist\u2014conditional receipts and binding receipts.\n  \uf0a7 The date on a receipt is always earlier than the policy\u2019s issue date.\n  \uf0a7 Today, the most common type of premium receipt is a conditional receipt.\nConditional Receipts\n  \uf0a7 Conditional receipts generally provide coverage as of the date of the receipt as long as a specific\n    condition is satisfied.\n  \uf0a7 Coverage is provided if the proposed insured demonstrates insurability.\n  \uf0a7 Insurability may be accomplished simply by submitting the application and supporting documentation,\n    or it may require a medical exam.\n  \uf0a7 Coverage is effective on the condition that the applicant proves to be insurable, either on the date on\n    which the application was signed or the date of the medical exam.\n  \uf0a7 If the applicant proves to be uninsurable, no coverage takes effect, and the premium is refunded.\nInsurability Type Conditional Receipt\n  \uf0a7 Coverage is effective if the proposed insured is found to be insurable as applied for (i.e., standard or\n    better).\n  \uf0a7 Coverage is effective as of the application date or the date of any required medical exam, whichever is\n    later.\n  \uf0a7 Policy delivery is not necessary for coverage to be in effect.\n    [EXAM TIP: If the test refers to a conditional receipt with no further qualification,\n    assume it\u2019s an \u201cinsurability type conditional receipt.\u201d]\n\nApproval Type Conditional Receipt\n  \uf0a7 Approval type conditional receipts provide coverage only after the insurer has approved the\n    application.\n  \uf0a7 Approval type conditional receipts only provide coverage between the issue date and the delivery date.\nBinding Receipts\n  \uf0a7 Binding receipts are often referred to as temporary insurance agreements.\n  \uf0a7 Binding receipt guarantees coverage unless the insurer formally rejects the application.\n  \uf0a7 Even if uninsurable, the applicant is covered until the application is rejected.\n  \uf0a7 A binding receipt typically stipulates the maximum amount that\u2019s payable under the terms of the\n    receipt.\n  \uf0a7 Binding receipts are far more common for auto or homeowner\u2019s insurance than life or health\n    insurance.\nTemporary Insurance Agreement\n  \uf0a7 A \u201ctemporary insurance agreement\u201d is similar to a binding receipt.\n  \uf0a7 In some jurisdictions, they\u2019re used interchangeably.\n  \uf0a7 In contrast to a binding receipt, this agreement can offer a level of additional protection.\nOffer and Counter-Offer\n  \uf0a7 If an applicant completes an application and pays the first full premium, the applicant has made a legal\n    offer.\n  \uf0a7 If the insurer issues a policy as requested, it has accepted the applicant\u2019s offer and a contract is in force.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f If the insurer declines the application, it has rejected the offer.\n    \uf0a7 If the insurance company is willing to issue a \u201crated\u201d policy at a higher than requested premium, the\n      carrier has rejected the applicant\u2019s initial offer but is making a counter-offer.\n    \uf0a7 The applicant can accept the counter-offer by paying the additional premium and providing a\n      statement of continued good health.\n\nPOLICY ISSUE AND DELIVERY\n   \uf0a7 Once issued, the policy is sent to the agent for delivery to the applicant.\n   \uf0a7 In most states, an agent is required to deliver an outline of coverage to the applicant.\n   \uf0a7 In some cases (e.g., when selling long-term care insurance), agents must also deliver a Shopper\u2019s\n     Guide or Buyer\u2019s Guide (generally before the agent accepts the applicant\u2019s initial premium).\n   \uf0a7 The outline of coverage describes (in simplified language) the key elements of the specific policy\n     being delivered.\n\n Policy Effective Date\n   \uf0a7 Determining a policy\u2019s effective date is important because it identifies when the coverage begins and\n     establishes the due date for future annual premiums.\n   \uf0a7 If a premium receipt were issued, the receipt\u2019s date would generally become the policy\u2019s effective date.\n   \uf0a7 If the applicant doesn\u2019t pay an initial premium with the application, the insurance company will\n     determine the policy\u2019s effective date, which will generally be the issue date. (Coverage will not truly\n     be in force until it\u2019s delivered, the first premium is paid, and a Statement of Good Health is obtained.)\n\n Constructive Delivery\n   \uf0a7 Constructive delivery means that an insurance carrier can legally deliver a policy without physically\n     delivering the contract into the policy owner\u2019s possession.\n   \uf0a7 Constructive delivery occurs if the insurer intentionally relinquishes all control over the policy and\n     turns it over to a person who\u2019s acting for the policy owner, including the company\u2019s own agent.\n   \uf0a7 Mailing the policy to the agent for unconditional delivery to the policy owner also constitutes\n     constructive delivery.\n   \uf0a7 If the company requires a delivery receipt or statement of continued good health, there\u2019s no\n     constructive delivery.\n   \uf0a7 Possession of a policy by the client doesn\u2019t establish delivery if all conditions have not been met.\n Inspection Receipt\n   \uf0a7 Some proposed insureds may want to review a policy before purchasing it.\n   \uf0a7 In this situation, the policy owner will sign an inspection receipt rather than a statement of continued\n     good health and will not pay a premium.\n   \uf0a7 The prospective insured will examine the policy and then pay the first full premium.\n   \uf0a7 The free-look period makes this receipt obsolete.\n\n Explaining the Policy and Ratings to Clients\n   \uf0a7 Most applicants will not remember all of the essential elements of their policies; therefore, agents\n     should deliver them in person.\n   \uf0a7 By personally explaining the policy, the agent can avert misunderstandings, policy returns, and\n     potential lapses.\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 . All rights reserved  \n\f  \uf0a7 When the policy is a \u201crated\u201d or substandard contract, the agent can discuss the reasons for it being so,\n    including the insured\u2019s increased need for protection.\n\nObtaining a Statement of Insured's Good Health\n  \uf0a7 If the initial premium is not paid until delivery, the agent must collect the premium and obtain from\n    the insured a signed statement attesting to the insured\u2019s continued good health.\n  \uf0a7 Because there can be no contract until the premium is paid, the company has a right to know that the\n    policy holder has remained in reasonably good health from the time the policy holder signed the\n    application until receiving the policy.\n\nDelivery (Policy) Receipt\n  \uf0a7 When a producer delivers a policy to an insured, the insurance company often wants a delivery receipt\n    as proof of delivery.\n  \uf0a7 The delivery receipt is important because it designates the start of the policy\u2019s free-look period.\n\n       Copyright \u00a9 .
