      "content": "HEALTH INSURANCE\n\nThe Role of Insurance  In general terms, insurance can be defined as a legal contract that transfers an uncertain risk from one party to another.  Insurance can also be described as the transfer of risk through the pooling or accumulation of funds because it distributes one person’s risk among a large number of people.  The insured transfers the possibility of suffering a large financial loss to an insurer in return for paying a relatively small, contractually defined premium.  Insurance helps to reduce the financial uncertainty of the policy owner that could otherwise result from future losses.  Insurance has become an essential element of any financial planning process. Benefits and Costs of Insurance to Society  Insurance policies indemnify policyholders.  To indemnify means to restore a person to the financial position they experienced prior to the insured loss.  The ability of insurance to eliminate the potential cost of unexpected or untimely losses is arguably its most significant advantage.\n\nTypes of Insurance Companies  There are many ways to classify insurance carriers, including: ‒ Where the company was formed ‒ How ownership is structured ‒ Whether the company is authorized to conduct business in a given state, or ‒ Whether the insurer is a commercial carrier or government provider Private versus Government Insurers  Private citizens own commercial insurers, which may be proprietary or cooperative.  Federal and state governments also offer a variety of coverages, commonly referred to as social insurance.  Federal and state-owned government insurers either: ‒ Cover catastrophic perils or losses that are not insurable by commercial insurers, or ‒ Cover insurable risks in competition with, or instead of, commercial insurers.  Examples of social insurance programs include: ‒ Social Security ‒ Original Medicare ‒ Medicaid ‒ SGLI and VGLI ‒ National Flood Insurance Program ‒ Federal Crop Insurance Corporation\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nPrivate (Commercial) Insurance Companies\n\n◦ Companies that sell more than one line of insurance are referred to as multi-line insurers.\n\n◦ A company that only sells one line of insurance is a monoline insurer.\n\n◦ Stock and mutual companies are both be considered commercial insurers, and, as such, both can write\n\nlife, health, property, and casualty insurance.\n\n◦ Regulators require companies to maintain a certain percentage of surplus revenue as reserves to pay\n\nfuture claims. These funds are referred to as statutory reserves.\n\nSTOCK COMPANIES – NON-PARTICIPATING\n\n◦ A stock insurance company is one that’s owned by private investors (stockholders or shareholders).\n\n◦ Stock insurers are incorporated under state laws, are structured like any other corporation, and their\n\ngoal is to make profits for their shareholders.\n\n◦ Typically, they’re publicly traded.\n\n◦ A portion of the company’s profits may be distributed to shareholders as dividends.\n\n◦ Stock insurers issue non-participating insurance policies.\n\n◦ Non-participating policies don’t pay policy dividends.\n\n◦ Purchasing a non-participating policy does NOT give policy owners any other privileges of\n\nownership.\n\n◦ Post-tax earnings (earned surplus) that are retained by a company are considered equity and are\n\nowned by the shareholders.\n\nMUTUAL COMPANIES – PARTICIPATING\n\n◦ Mutual insurance companies are also organized under state laws but are owned by the\n\npolicyholders.\n\n◦ Policyholders have the right to vote for the board of directors.\n\n◦ Mutual insurance companies are considered participating insurers because policy owners receive a\n\nshare of surplus revenue in the form of policy dividends.\n\n◦ Mutual insurers hold such excess earnings as a divisible surplus.\n\n◦ Mutual insurers return this surplus to their policy owners by paying policy dividends.\n\n◦ Policy dividends represent a refund of that portion of the premium remaining after a company has set\n\naside the necessary reserves.\n\n◦ In some cases, a stock company may be converted into a mutual company through a process that’s\n\nreferred to as mutualization.\n\nASSESSMENT MUTUAL INSURERS\n\n◦ Assessment mutual companies are classified by the method in which they charge premiums.\n\n◦ Pure assessment mutual companies charge no premium in advance; instead, each member is assessed\n\na portion of the losses that occur.\n\n◦ Advance premium assessment companies charge premiums but levy assessments if the premium is\n\ninsufficient.

      "content": "◦ Fraternal societies are not-for-profit organizations noted for their social, charitable, and benevolent\n\nactivities.\n\n◦ Fraternal membership is based on religion, nationality, or ethnicity.\n\n◦ Fraternal societies also issue insurance covering their members.\n\n◦ To be characterized as a fraternal benefit society, the organization must have the following\n\ncharacteristics: ‒ It must be non-profit. ‒ It must have a lodge system, including ritualistic work and a representative form of government. ‒ It must exist for reasons other than obtaining insurance.\n\nRECIPROCAL INSURERS\n\n◦ A reciprocal insurer is an unincorporated organization in which individual members (also referred to\n\nas subscribers) agree to insure one another.\n\n◦ Unlike mutual or stock insurers, reciprocal policyholders don’t transfer these risks to a separate\n\ncorporate entity. Each policyholder individually assumes a share of the risk.\n\n◦ This arrangement makes the reciprocal insurer a risk-sharing mechanism rather than a form of risk\n\ntransfer.\n\n◦ Policyholders receive policy dividends as well as their share of the company surplus (capital) if they\n\nterminate their membership.\n\n◦ An attorney-in-fact handles transactions for the reciprocal insurer.\n\nRISK RETENTION GROUPS (RRGS)\n\n◦ A risk retention group is a specialized insurance company that’s created to provide liability\n\ninsurance for individuals and entities with a common bond.\n\n◦ The federal law requires risk retention groups to follow the laws of their home state.\n\n◦ Risk retention groups are only licensed in their state of domicile. In other jurisdictions, federal law\n\nprevails.\n\n◦ Risk retention groups hold on to risks and process claims\n\nRISK PURCHASING GROUPS (RPGS)\n\n◦ As with a risk retention group, a risk purchasing group provides insurance for individuals and entities\n\nwith a common bond.\n\n◦ RPGs differ from RRGs because they purchase coverage for their members from an insurance\n\ncompany rather than act as the insurer.\n\n◦ The risk purchasing group becomes a master policyholder, and its members receive certificates of\n\ninsurance.\n\nREINSURERS AND RETENTION LIMITS\n\n◦ Reinsurers insure other insurance companies that seek to limit the loss they would face if a substantial\n\nclaim became payable.\n\n◦ The insurance company that transfers its loss exposure (risk) to another insurer is referred to as the\n\nprimary insurer or ceding company.\n\n◦ The portion of the risk that a ceding insurer retains is considered the net retention.\n\nCopyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ The insurance company that accepts the risk is the reinsurer (also referred to as the assuming\n\ncompany).\n\n◦ There are two types of reinsurance contracts:\n\n‒ When two companies arrange for an automatic sharing risk based on specific criteria, it’s\n\n◦ considered treaty reinsurance.\n\n‒ When a primary insurer seeks reinsurance for a specific exposure without an ongoing agreement,\n\n◦ it’s considered facultative reinsurance.\n\nCaptive Insurers\n\n◦ A captive insurer is established and owned by a parent firm(s) to cover the parent’s loss exposure.\n\nSurplus Lines Insurance\n\n◦ Surplus lines carriers provide types of coverage that are not available through authorized carriers.\n\n◦ Consumers place the coverage through a surplus lines broker for high, substandard, or unusual risks\n\nthat are rejected for coverage in the authorized market. Lloyd’s of London\n\n◦ Lloyd’s of London is a syndicate of individuals that individually underwrite insurance but is NOT an\n\ninsurer.\n\n◦ Lloyd’s function is to provide coverages that may otherwise be unavailable.\n\nSelf-Insurers\n\n◦ A self-insurer establishes a self-funded plan to cover potential losses.\n\n◦ A self-insurer will often seek an insurance company that will provide insurance above a specified\n\nmaximum loss level.",

      "content": "Insurer Classifications Insurers Classified by Authorization  An insurer with a certificate of authority that allows it to do business in a particular state is referred to as an authorized or admitted insurer.  Generally, an unauthorized (non-admitted) insurance company is not permitted to conduct insurance operations unless it qualifies as a surplus lines carrier. Insurer Classified According to Domicile  A domestic insurer is organized and incorporated in the state in which it writes business. ‒ For example, if XYZ Insurance Company is incorporated in Wisconsin and writes policies in\n\n◦ Wisconsin, it’s a domestic company in that state.\n\n◦ A foreign insurer is authorized in one state but organized and incorporated under a different state’s\n\nlaws. ‒ For example, if XYZ Insurance Company is incorporated in Wisconsin but transacts insurance in\n\n◦ Iowa, it acts as a foreign insurance company in Iowa. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ An alien insurer is an insurer that’s organized under the laws of a different nation.\n\n‒ For example, Sun Financial Services of Toronto, Canada, is an alien insurer.\n\nDepartments within an Insurance Company  The marketing or sales division is responsible for increasing the number of prospective applicants.  The sales department completes applications and conducts face-to-face appointments with prospective buyers.  The underwriting department reviews applications, conducts investigations, determines whether to issue coverage, and assigns risk classifications.  The claims department investigates, processes, and pays claims.  The actuarial department calculates policy rates, reserves, and dividends.\n\nKey People Within an Insurance Company Producers  The term “Producer” refers to individuals who are licensed by the state regulatory authority to solicit, sell, or transact the placement of insurance products with the buying public.  Licensed producers act in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of both their insurers and their clients.  The various types of producers include: ‒ Agents represent one or more insurers under the terms of an appointment contract. ‒ Brokers represent themselves and the insureds. ‒ Solicitors are licensed in some states to represent a producer and solicit prospective applicants to\n\n◦ meet and discuss their insurance needs with that producer.\n\n‒ Service Representatives work in some states under a limited authority.\n\n◦ • They’re insurance company employees in some states that hold a limited license. • They don’t earn commissions for sales. • They’re not required to be licensed unless they solicit, countersign policies, or collect premiums from policy owners.\n\nUnderwriters\n\n◦ Underwriters identify, assess, examine, and classify the amount of risk represented by an applicant.\n\n◦ Underwriters approve or decline applications and determine the cost of insurance.\n\nActuaries\n\n◦ Actuaries calculate policy rates, reserves, and dividends.\n\nAdjusters\n\n◦ Adjusters investigate insurance claims to determine whether they should be settled or denied.\n\n◦ A public adjuster is compensated for acting on behalf of an insured regarding the settlement of an\n\ninsurance claim.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nHow Insurance is Sold\n\n◦ Most consumers purchase insurance through licensed producers who market insurance products and\n\nservices to the public.\n\n◦ Typically, these producers are agents who are appointed to represent one or more insurance\n\ncompanies.\n\n◦ Agents can bind insurance; in other words, they can commit the insurer to cover a risk exposure—at\n\nleast temporarily.\n\n◦ Some consumers may work with brokers who work for insureds to place coverage. Brokers are not\n\nappointed by the insurer and don’t have the authority to bind coverage.\n\n◦ In a sales transaction, agents represent the insurer, while brokers represent the buyer.\n\nCareer Agency System\n\n◦ A career agency is often a branch of a major stock or mutual insurance company.\n\n◦ A career agency may exist to represent an insurer in a specific geographical area or market.\n\n◦ A general agent (GA) typically runs a career agency.\n\n◦ The GA recruits, trains, and supervises career insurance agents.\n\n◦ The GA has a vested right in any business that’s written by those agents who sell for the agency.\n\nManagerial System\n\n◦ The managerial system is a form of career agency.\n\n◦ The insurance company hires a salaried branch manager to run the agency.",

Personal Producing General Agency System\n\n◦ The personal producing general agency (PPGA) system resembles the career agency system, but\n\nPPGAs don’t recruit, train, or supervise career agents.\n\n◦ A personal producing general agent focuses on selling insurance in an assigned market or geographic\n\narea.\n\n◦ PPGAs are generally responsible for maintaining their own offices and administrative staff.\n\n◦ Agents who are hired by a PPGA are considered employees of the PPGA, not the insurer.\n\nIndependent Agency System\n\n◦ The independent agency system is not tied to any particular insurance company.\n\n◦ Independent agents represent any number of insurance companies through contractual agreements.\n\nOther Methods of Selling Insurance\n\n◦ A large volume of business is also marketed through direct selling and mass marketing methods.\n\n◦ Insurance companies that use the direct selling method deal directly with consumers.\n\n◦ Direct sellers use vending machines, advertisements, or salaried sales representatives who are\n\nlicensed.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ Insurance is also sold through mass marketing techniques, such as over the Internet, newspapers,\n\nmagazines, radio, and television ads.\n\n◦ Mass marketing methods provide exposure to many consumers, often using direct selling methods\n\nwith occasional follow-up by agents.\n\nEvolution of Industry Oversight  The insurance industry is regulated by a number of authorities, including some within the industry itself.  The primary purpose of this regulation is to promote public welfare. Federal Court Cases and Legislation Affecting Insurance Industry Regulation  In the 1868 case of Paul v. Virginia, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the sale and issuance of insurance is not interstate commerce, thereby upholding a state’s right to regulate insurance.  In the 1944 case, the United States v. Southeastern Underwriters Association (SEUA), the United States Supreme Court revisited the issue of state versus federal regulation. ‒ The Supreme Court reversed Paul v. Virginia and ruled that the insurance industry is a form of\n\n◦ interstate commerce.\n\n‒ The Court determined that the federal government should regulate insurance.\n\n◦ In 1945, Congress passed Public Law 15—the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The McCarran-Ferguson\n\nAct created the following: ‒ It called for the states to continue their regulation of the insurance industry because it was in the\n\n◦ public’s best interest.\n\n‒ It also made possible the application of federal antitrust laws so far as state laws did not regulate\n\n◦ such activity.\n\n‒ Today, the insurance industry is both state-regulated and in conformity with federal antitrust\n\n◦ requirements.\n\n‒ Any person who violates the McCarran-Ferguson act faces a fine of $10,000 or up to one year in\n\n◦ prison.\n\n◦ In 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act was enacted to protect privacy by requiring the fair and\n\naccurate reporting of consumer information and for insurers to inform applicants about any investigations being made ‒ If insurers deny coverage or charge higher rates due to a consumer report, the applicant must\n\n◦ receive the name of the relevant reporting agency.\n\n‒ Insurers that fail to comply are liable for actual and punitive damages. ‒ The maximum penalty for obtaining consumer reports under false pretenses is a $5,000 fine and\n\n◦ up to one year in prison.\n\n◦ In 1994, Congress amended Sections 1033 and 1034 of the United States Code (USC) regarding\n\nFraud and False Statements. ‒ It’s a criminal offense for felons who are convicted of crimes involving dishonesty or a breach of\n\n◦ trust to participate in the insurance business without a “Letter of Written Consent” from their state insurance regulators.\n\n‒ The law makes it illegal to lie, falsify, or conceal information from a federal official. ‒ Any person that engages in intentionally unfair or deceptive insurance practices is violating\n\n◦ federal law. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n‒ Other violations include embezzling money, misappropriating insurance premiums, and writing\n\n◦ threatening letters to insurance offices.\n\n‒ The punishment for violation is a fine of up to $50,000, up to 15 years in prison, and license\n\n◦ revocation.\n\n◦ In 1999, the Financial Services Modernization Act removed the barriers that kept commercial",

The law aims to detect, deter, and disrupt terrorist efforts and funding while prosecuting international money laundering.\n\n◦ In 2003, the Do Not Call Implementation Act implemented the Do Not Call Registry.\n\n‒ The Act allows consumers to list their phones so that telemarketers (including insurers) cannot\n\n◦ legally make solicitation calls.\n\n‒ Calls made on behalf of charities, political organizations, and surveys are exempt.\n\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC)\n\n◦ The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is an industry association that consists\n\nof all state insurance regulators.\n\n◦ The NAIC brings together regulators and industry personnel on committees that study various aspects\n\nof insurance practices, laws, and regulations.\n\n◦ The organization has four broad objectives:\n\n1. To encourage regulatory uniformity among the states 2. To promote efficiency in the administration of laws and regulations 3. To protect policy owners and consumer interests, and 4. To preserve state regulation of the insurance business\n\n◦ The NAIC recognizes that state laws regarding insurance marketing, trade practices, and regulations\n\nmay vary, but share more similarities than differences. Model Acts and Model Regulations developed by the NAIC provide a template for individual state legislators and regulators.\n\n◦ The NAIC is not a regulatory organization. Instead, the models it creates provide a common\n\nframework for state officials that allow the various governing bodies to meet the specific needs of their respective jurisdictions while helping to streamline the legislative and administrative processes and helping to standardize the outcomes.\n\nUNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES ACT (MODEL)\n\n◦ Most jurisdictions have adopted their own version of the NAIC model “Unfair Trade Practices Act.”\n\n◦ This Act gives the head of each state insurance department the power to investigate insurance\n\ncompanies and producers.\n\n◦ It authorizes them to issue cease and desist orders and impose penalties.\n\n◦ The Act also gives officers the authority to seek a court injunction to restrain unfair activities, such as\n\nmisrepresentation and false advertising, coercion and intimidation, and unfair discrimination.\n\nNAIC ADVERTISING CODE\n\n◦ Many states also subscribe to the NAIC’s Model Advertising Code, which labels certain words and\n\nphrases as misleading by their very nature.\n\n◦ These misleading words or phrases can never be used in any insurance advertisement.\n\nCopyright © . All rights reserved\n\nThe National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL)\n\n◦ In 1969, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL) was formed. The NCOIL’s\n\nprincipal membership is comprised of state legislators from around the nation that serve on state insurance and financial institutions committees.\n\n◦ As with the NAIC, NCOIL works to preserve state regulation of the industry, but it also works to\n\neducate public policymakers on related issues.\n\n◦ NCOIL also writes model laws.\n\nTHE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS\n\n(NAIFA)and The National Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU)  These organizations created a Code of Ethics which details the expectations of agents in their duties toward clients.",

Best) is to determine an insurer’s financial strength.  Financial strength can be evaluated by examining a company’s reserves and liquidity. ‒ Reserves are the accounting measurement of an insurer’s future obligations to its policyholders.\n\n◦ They are classified as liabilities for the insurance company.\n\n‒ Liquidity indicates a company’s ability to make unpredictable payouts to policy owners.

In other words, they\n\nwill not receive more than they lost.\n\n◦ Most accident, health, property, and casualty insurance contracts are all contracts of indemnity.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers (Spread of Risk) The law of large numbers holds that, based on experience, the greater the number of homogenous loss exposures, the more likely the overall likelihood of loss can be predicted.\n\n◦ The law of large numbers does NOT predict whether an individual suffers a loss.\n\n◦ The law of large numbers helps predict the losses that those in the risk pool will suffer in the\n\naggregate.\n\n◦ For example, let’s assume that a carrier insures one million people against accidental death. In this case, the carrier is more likely to accurately predict the number of accidental deaths than a company that insures only 1,000 people against the same peril.\n\nAdverse Selection\n\n◦ Adverse selection is defined as the tendency for higher-than-average risks to seek out insurance more\n\nfrequently than those who are lower risk.\n\n◦ If an insurer suffers a financial loss due to adverse selection, it has inaccurately calculated the risk of\n\nloss and consequently charged inadequate premiums. Companies must avoid adverse selection to be profitable and stay in business. Sound and competent underwriting may reduce the chance of adverse selection.\n\nPerils, Loss, and Hazards Perils (CAUSES of Loss)  A peril is the immediate and specific cause of a loss. Each line of insurance covers a different set of perils and losses.  Accident and health insurance policies cover losses that are caused by illnesses and accidents.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ For life insurance and annuities, the primary covered peril is death.\n\n◦ Life insurance protects against premature death.\n\n◦ Annuities protect income when a person’s life span is greater than the statistical average, and the\n\ninsured would otherwise outlive his assets.\n\nNamed Perils versus Special (Open) Perils  Insurance contracts that cover Specified or Named Perils will individually list perils that they cover.  If a loss is caused by a peril that’s not listed within the insurance policy, then the loss is not covered. For example, an accidental death and dismemberment policy only covers certain losses, and only those due to accidents. By naming and defining specific causes of loss, a named- peril policy defines covered losses narrowly.  Insurance contracts that use a Special or Open Peril definition of covered causes of loss offer insurance that protects against a broad spectrum of potential losses. These policies start by stating that they cover all direct causes of loss and then list any excluded perils.  Any peril that’s not explicitly excluded is covered. For example, an individual disability income policy covers losses due to either illnesses or accidents. They also cover job-related losses as well as those that are not.",

      "content": "Loss  A loss is defined as an unintended and unforeseen reduction or destruction of financial or economic value.  A loss can also be defined as either an accident or an occurrence.  An accident is an unforeseen, unexpected, unintended, and sudden event, which occurs at a specific time and specific place.  An occurrence is any event that causes a loss. Occurrences include accidents, illnesses, and losses that are caused by repeated or continuous exposure to conditions over time.\n\n[EXAM TIP: Every accident is an occurrence, but not every occurrence is an accident.]  A Direct Loss results when a person is hurt, killed, or property is damaged or destroyed.  The peril is the proximate cause of the direct loss.  An Indirect Loss is also referred to as a “Consequential Loss” because the loss results from a direct loss. For example, if an individual suffers an injury that causes her to be disabled for six months, her injury is a direct loss. The individual’s loss of income, which occurs because the injury results in her inability to work, is indirect.  Loss exposure is the risk of a possible loss. Basically, any situation that presents the possibility of a loss. Copyright © . All rights reserved  Homogeneous exposure units are similar objects of insurance exposed to the same group of perils.  A loss exposure consists of loss exposure units. Hazards  A hazard increases the possibility that a loss will occur. Examples of hazards include icy roads, driving while intoxicated, and improperly stored toxic waste.  There are three types of hazards—physical hazards, moral hazards, and morale hazards.  Physical hazards are physical or tangible conditions existing in a manner that makes a loss more likely to occur. Poor health and ice on roads are examples of physical hazards.  Moral hazards make a loss more likely to occur due to the dishonest character of the insured.  Properly defined, a moral hazard occurs when the insured is much more intentioned and conscious of participating in wrongdoing that’s more likely to lead to a loss. For example, a dishonest person is more likely to lie to their insurance company, both on an application and when submitting a claim. Negative habits such as drug use, alcohol abuse, and smoking are commonly associated with moral hazards.  Morale hazards arise from a state of mind related to the indifference of an insured to whatever loss may occur.  The insured unintentionally creates a loss situation because he doesn’t care about loss prevention since the property is insured.\n\nRisk  Risk is defined as the potential or uncertainty for loss. Types of Risk  Speculative risks are not insurable because they offer the opportunity for gains as well as losses.  Pure risks are insurable because there’s only the potential for loss, not gain.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nElements of an Insurable Risk\n\n◦ In general, insurable risk must include the following elements:\n\n‒ An insurable loss must be due to chance (accidental), which means that the cause must be\n\n◦ outside of an insured’s control. This characteristic helps insurers avoid adverse selection.\n\n‒ An insurable loss must be definite and measurable, which means that the time, place, and\n\n◦ amount are known.\n\n‒ An insurable loss must be predictable, which means that the probability of loss in the future can\n\n◦ be calculated. There must be a sufficient number of homogeneous loss exposure units to do so.\n\n‒ An insurable loss cannot be catastrophic, which means that a loss cannot be too big or\n\n◦ uncertain to calculate. The loss exposure must be reasonable.\n\n‒ The loss exposure to be insured must be substantial. ‒ The premium cost must be economically feasible; it must be small relative to the covered loss\n\n◦ exposure.\n\nINSURANCE RISK CLASSIFICATIONS\n\n◦ Typically, an insurer will place a risk into one of the following three classifications:",

      "content": "General Law of Contracts  Insurance contracts are binding legal agreements between two parties—a policyowner and insurer. In most cases, the policyowner is also the insured. Some life insurance policies are not owned by the person being insured.  If an insurance exam asks for the identity of the party that enters into an agreement with an insurance company when buying a policy, the proper answer is “the policyowner,” even if “the insured” is also given as a choice.  The only time “the insured” is the correct answer is when “policyowner” (or “policyholder”) is not given as a possible answer.  The beneficiary is not a party to the contract.  The following four essential elements must be contained in every contract for it to be legally valid and binding (enforceable). We can remember them using the mnemonic “C.L.O.C.”.\n\n◦ 1. Competent parties 2. Legal purpose 3. Offer and acceptance 4. Consideration\n\n◦ The four elements can be remembered using the mnemonic “C, L, O, C.”\n\nCompetent Parties\n\n◦ The parties to the contract must be legally competent and must possess the capacity to make binding\n\nagreements.\n\n◦ The parties must be mentally sound, sober, of sufficient age, and not disqualified on other legal grounds.\n\n◦ Individuals that may be barred from entering into a legally binding contract include:\n\n‒ Minors as defined by state law ‒ Insane or mentally incompetent individuals ‒ Individuals who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of application ‒ Persons who are forced or coerced into a contract ‒ Enemy aliens ‒ Convicts (based on state law) Legal Purpose\n\n◦ For a contract to be enforceable, the contract must have a legal purpose. The object of the contract\n\nand the reason for the parties to enter into the agreement must be legal. Offer and Acceptance\n\n◦ Both parties to the insurance contract must agree to the contract terms before they become valid and\n\nin-force.\n\n◦ The first party that commits to the contract is offering to enter into a legally binding agreement.\n\n◦ The second party’s commitment is legally considered an acceptance of the offer. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ An offer plus an acceptance is often referred to as the agreement.\n\n◦ When the applicant for an insurance policy submits a completed application and pays the initial\n\npremium, she’s making an offer. When the insurer issues the policy as requested, it accepts the offer.\n\n◦ If a consumer submits an application without an initial premium, the consumer is NOT making an\n\noffer because no transaction can be completed without the payment of the initial premium. Instead, the consumer is asking the insurer to make an offer by issuing a policy. The consumer accepts the offer by paying the initial premium. Consideration\n\n◦ For any agreement to be binding, both parties must provide each other with some item of value, which\n\nis the definition of “consideration.”\n\n◦ An applicant’s consideration is the premium paid and the representations (i.e., statements) made.\n\n◦ The insurer’s consideration is the promise to pay legitimate claims.\n\n◦ Consideration is the binding force of any insurance policy.",

      "content": "Special Features of Insurance Contracts Aleatory Contract  An insurance contract is an aleatory contract because one party may recover more in value than he has paid.  The value of the policyowner’s potential benefit (i.e., claim payment) is generally higher than the value (i.e., premium) that’s received by the insurer.  There’s no guarantee that the insured will receive a benefit. Performance is based on an uncertain future event involving unequal bargaining value. For example, an individual who has a disability insurance policy will collect benefits if she becomes disabled. However, if no disability occurs, benefits are not paid. Another example illustrating the aleatory nature of insurance contracts is a life insurance policy that pays out a $20,000 death benefit after only $100 of premiums were collected. Contract of Adhesion  Insurance policies are contracts of adhesion.  They’re contracts that are prepared by only one of the parties—the insurance company.  There’s no negotiation regarding the terms. The insurer sets the terms, and the applicant can either “take it or leave it.”  In any contract of adhesion, the party that dictates the contract terms must make those terms clear.  The doctrine regarding ambiguities in a contract of adhesion favors the party that did not create the contract terms. When it comes to insurance policies, the courts will rule in favor of the insured.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ The doctrine of reasonable expectations stipulates that an insurance contract may be interpreted by a\n\n“reasonable” consumer to mean what the producer or insurer has indicated it means or what he has interpreted or expected it to mean.\n\nUNILATERAL CONTRACT\n\n◦ Insurance policies are unilateral contracts because only the insurer makes an enforceable promise.\n\n◦ Insurers promise to pay benefits upon the occurrence of a specific event, such as death or disability.\n\n◦ The applicant makes no promise to continue the policy and can cancel it at any time.\n\n◦ The insurer’s promise remains in force as long as the policyowner pays the required premium.\n\n◦ Most forms of insurance are personal contracts because they’re non-transferrable.\n\n◦ Insurance contracts always insure a person, even when they insure property. A homeowner’s policy\n\ndoesn’t merely cover a house; it also covers the person who owns the house. When the person sells the house, the coverage cannot be transferred to the new owner.\n\n◦ Life insurance is an exception to this rule. Life insurance is NOT a personal contract.\n\n◦ Life insurance contracts can be treated as financial assets. They can be used collateral for loans and\n\ncan be sold to third parties under the terms of a viatical or senior settlement.\n\nCONDITIONAL CONTRACT\n\n◦ Insurance policies are conditional contracts because the insurance company’s performance is\n\ncontingent on the occurrence of uncertain future events.\n\n◦ The insurer must only fulfill its promise to pay if a covered loss occurs while the policy is in force.\n\n◦ The insurer’s obligations under the contract are conditioned on the performance of specific acts by the\n\ninsured or the beneficiary. For example, the insured must provide notice of claim and proof of loss.\n\nVALUED CONTRACT OR INDEMNITY CONTRACT\n\n◦ Insurance policies indemnify an insured in one of two ways. Some policies have a fixed value, while\n\nothers have benefits that are tied to the loss of assets, income, or health.\n\n◦ A valued contract, such as life insurance, pays a stated sum regardless of the actual loss incurred.\n\n◦ An indemnity contract pays an amount which is equal to a loss that’s identified in the policy.\n\n◦ Some contracts of indemnity are reimbursement policies that directly reimburse the insured for claim-\n\nrelated expenses.\n\n◦ Other indemnity contracts define their benefits as a certain amount of money per day, week, or month\n\nto offset a loss of revenue (as in a disability policy) or some portion of periodic expenses (such as long-term care).

      "content": "◦ Most policies require insurable interest to exist at the time of purchase and at the time of claim.\n\n◦ For a life or health insurance contract, insurable interest is only required at the time of the application.\n\nInsurable interest doesn’t need to exist at the time of claim.\n\n◦ To have “an insurable interest” in oneself or another person, an individual must have a reasonable\n\nexpectation of benefiting from the other person’s continued life. Conversely, she will suffer a financial loss if the person becomes ill, suffers an injury, or dies.\n\nNegotiating and Issuing Insurance Policies  An insurance policy is a written contract in which one party promises to compensate another against loss from an unknown event.  A policy rider or endorsement is a legal attachment which amends a policy. Utmost Good Faith  Utmost good faith means that the policyowner and the insurer both know all of the relevant information that’s material to the agreement. The critical concept is full disclosure. Reasonable Expectations  The Doctrine of Reasonable Expectations is the legal principle which stipulates that the terms of contracts should be interpreted as may reasonably be expected when ambiguous. Warranty  A warranty is a statement that’s guaranteed to be true in every respect. It becomes part of the contract and can be grounds for revoking the agreement if found to be untrue. Representation  A representation is a statement which is made by the applicant and is considered to be true and accurate to the best of the applicant’s belief.  A false statement made by an applicant that would influence an insurer in determining whether to accept the risk is considered a material misrepresentation. Concealment  Concealment is defined as the failure or neglect by the applicant to disclose a known, material fact.  An insurance company has the right to rescind the insurance contract in response to either an intentional or unintentional concealment.  The insurer must prove the concealment exists and that it’s material to the insurance policy.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nVoid versus Voidable Contracts\n\n• For example, if a life insurance applicant asks his friend to impersonate him during a medical\n\nexam in hopes of qualifying for coverage, any resulting policy would be void. It would never be in\n\neffect because the insurance company doesn’t have the right person’s consideration. Also, it\n\ndoesn’t have medical data about the applicant which is necessary to underwrite the policy.\n\n◦ The injured party may have the right to terminate the agreement.\n\nFRAUD\n\n◦ Fraud is an intentional misrepresentation regarding a claim or policy application that a consumer\n\nmakes to obtain benefit payments or policy coverage under false pretenses.\n\n◦ Life insurance contracts cannot be voided after they have been in force for two years. After two years,\n\nthe policies become incontestable.\n\n◦ Guaranteed renewable health insurance policies usually have two or three years, depending on state\n\nlaw. After this time, they also become incontestable.\n\n◦ The ability of insurers to void other health insurance policies due to fraud is not necessarily limited.\n\nThis will be addressed in the section titled “Time Limit on Certain Defenses.”\n\nPAROLE EVIDENCE RULE\n\n◦ The parole evidence rule limits a contract to its written terms. Oral statements that are made before\n\nthe formation of a contract are not admissible in court unless they become part of the written contract.\n\nWAIVER\n\n◦ A waiver is the voluntary surrendering (giving up) of a known right.\n\n◦ A waiver is also defined as “the deliberate, voluntary, or intentional abandonment of a known right by\n\nan insurer.”\n\n◦ One example of an insurer waiving a right occurs if an incomplete application is mistakenly accepted.\n\nOnce the policy is issued, the insurer cannot contest a later claim based on the missing information.\n\nESTOPPEL\n\n◦ Estoppel requires an insurer to abide by misleading or incorrect statements that are made by one of its\n\nagents, even if it can demonstrate that the governing policy form contradicts the agent.\n\n◦ Under certain circumstances, this legal principle prevents the insurer from escaping the consequences",

Principles of Agency Law  The four essential principles of agency law include: 1. Acts of an agent are equal to the acts of the principal. 2. Under law, a contract that’s completed by an agent is also completed by the principal. 3. Payments that are received by an agent for the principal are received by the principal. 4. If an agent knows it, it’s presumed that the insurance company does as well. Agent Authority  “Authority” is what an insurer grants a licensee to transact insurance on its behalf.  In reality, an agent’s authority can be quite broad. Express Authority Express authority is the agent’s authority which is expressly granted in his agency contract.  The principal deliberately gives this authority to one or more agents.  For example, an agent has the express authority to bind coverage for applicants on behalf of the company. Implied Authority Implied authority describes the authority we assume an agent needs to transact the principal’s business as expressed in the contract.  Implied authority is incidental to express authority.  Implied authority encompasses the little things an agent needs to do to accomplish the tasks expressly assigned to him under the terms of his agent contract. Apparent Authority Apparent authority is the appearance of authority regardless of whether it actually exists.  Apparent authority relies on the perception of an agent’s authority based on the actions, words, or deeds of the principal.\n\n◦ Copyright © .

      "content": "GENERAL CONCEPTS OF LIFE INSURANCE\n\nTypes of Life Insurance Policies\n\nIndustrial life insurance issues small face amounts, such as $1,000 or $2,000. Premiums are paid weekly\n\nand collected by debit agents. They were designed for burial coverage.\n\nGroup life insurance is written for members of a group, such as a place of employment, association, or a\n\nunion. Coverage is provided to the members of that group under one master contract. The group is\n\nunderwritten as a whole, not on each member. Typically, group life insurance doesn’t require evidence of\n\ninsurability and is cheaper than individual life insurance.\n\nOrdinary life comprises several types of individual life insurance, such as temporary (term) and\n\npermanent (whole).\n\nTerm life insurance gives a person the most considerable amount of coverage for a limited period. Term\n\ninsurance is only in effect for a limited period because it has a TERMination date. Term insurance is an\n\ninexpensive type of insurance, which makes it an attractive option for policies with a significant face\n\nvalue. Term life is the CHEAPEST type of pure life insurance due to the fact that it has a termination date\n\nand doesn’t have any cash value. Term life insurance will ALWAYS be cheaper than a whole life policy\n\nwith the same face value. It provides pure death protection since it only pays a death benefit if the insured\n\ndies during the policy term.\n\nLevel term insurance, also referred to as level premium level term, requires a fixed, low premium in\n\nexchange for level protection that lasts a specified period. For example, if a person needs life insurance\n\nthat provides coverage for the remainder of her working years and wants to pay as little as possible, she\n\nwill need Level term.\n\nLevel term life insurance is often renewal and convertible. For example, a person has a 10-year renewable\n\nand convertible term policy. At the conclusion of the 10 years, the policy terminates, or she can renew it. If\n\nshe renews it, the premium price will go up, and she will have the policy for another 10 years. This cycle\n\ncan continue until she’s too old to renew it or it’s too expensive. All TERM insurance has a final\n\nTERMINATION date after which it can no longer be renewed. If the policy is CONVERTIBLE, a person\n\ncan CONVERT it to whole life (think, rent to own) at any time. Whenever a person renews or converts\n\nANY insurance, she doesn’t need to worry about her health (i.e., her insurability is locked in). However,\n\nthe price will always rise because her current (attained) age is used for your new policy. Term life\n\ninsurance is typically thought of as “renting.” The concept is that a person has a roof over her head, but the\n\nprice of renting is going to rise until it no longer makes sense to continue renting or, at some point, the\n\nrental contract is TERMINATED, and she gets kicked out.\n\nPremiums are initially higher for non-renewable level term insurance than renewable term life insurance\n\nbecause they’re level throughout the policy period. However, with renewable term insurance, the\n\npremiums will increase at each renewal and eventually exceed those of standard level term insurance.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nDecreasing term life insurance provides an annually decreasing face amount over time with level\n\npremiums. A decreasing term policy is a type of life policy with a death benefit that adjusts periodically\n\n(according to a schedule) and is written for a specific period. Decreasing term policies are generally\n\nwritten for the protection of a mortgage or other debt that typically decreases over time until it’s paid\n\noff. For example, a 15-year decreasing term policy could protect a 15-year mortgage. As the mortgage\n\nbalance reduces each year, the face value of the insurance policy will adjust accordingly to match. After\n\nTHE MORTGAGE IS PAID OFF, THE INSURANCE POLICY WILL EXPIRE.\n\nCredit policies are typically purchased using a decreasing term life insurance policy, with a term that’s\n\nmatched to the length of the loan period and the decreasing insurance amount matched to the declining\n\nloan balance.

      "content": "due on a loan if the debtor dies before the loan is repaid, credit policies can only be purchased for up to\n\nthe amount of the debt or loan outstanding. For example, if a person wants an insurance policy to protect a\n\n$20,000, five-year auto loan, he could use a five-year decreasing term life insurance policy with an initial\n\nface value of $20,000. He will pay the same level premium every month for the five-year term of the\n\npolicy. The face value will start at $20,000 and change according to a schedule (the auto loan). After five\n\nyears, the car will be paid off, and the insurance policy will no longer be needed.\n\nIncreasing term life insurance provides an increasing face amount over time based on specific amounts\n\nOR A PERCENTAGE OF THE ORIGINAL FACE AMOUNT.\n\nConvertible term life insurance policies have a provision that allows the policyowner to convert the\n\nterm insurance into a permanent insurance policy without proof of insurability. For example, John\n\ntook out a low-cost term life insurance policy when he was young to take advantage of his excellent\n\nhealth. Knowing that the policy would eventually terminate, John wanted the option to convert the policy\n\nto a permanent one for final expense benefits when his finances improve. The conversion privilege of a\n\ngroup term life policy allows an individual to leave the group term (temporary) plan and convert his\n\ninsurance to an individual (permanent) policy without providing evidence of insurability.\n\nTerm life insurance policies are typically converted using the insured’s attained (current) age, not the age\n\nof the insured at the time of the original application. The insured’s age is a primary factor for calculating\n\npremium costs. Therefore, using the insured’s current (attained) age will result in higher premiums than\n\nusing the insured’s original age. For example, a $25,000 policy on a healthy seven-year-old boy will cost\n\nsubstantially less than a $25,000 policy on a 57-year-old man.\n\nWhether converting an individual or group term insurance policy, the insured’s insurability is guaranteed.\n\nHowever, the cost of the policy will be based on her current (attained) age, not the age when she applied\n\nfor the original term policy. Convertible term insurance allows the insured to enroll in temporary coverage\n\nand later change it to permanent coverage without insurability (good health). However, the premiums will\n\nINCREASE DUE TO USING THE INSURED’S ATTAINED AGE.\n\nRenewable term insurance guarantees the insured the right to continue term coverage after the expiration\n\nof the initial policy period without proving insurability. When a term policy is renewed, the insured is\n\nnot required to prove insurability. However, the premium price will rise because the insurance company\n\nwill use the insured’s current or attained age to determine the new premiums. If a customer wants\n\ncoverage at the lowest possible cost that was good for a limited period but offers the ability to continue the\n\ncoverage after the expiration, the customer will want a renewable term policy. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nAnnual renewable term coverage provides a level face amount that renews annually. This type of\n\ncoverage is guaranteed renewable annually without proof of insurability.\n\nWhole life insurance provides a permanent death benefit for the entire life of the insured, but it also\n\nprovides living benefits in the form of cash values and policy loans. Whole life insurance typically has a\n\nlevel premium and matures once the insured attains the age of 100.\n\nAdvantages of whole life insurance:  Covers the entire life of the insured  Living benefits – cash value and policy loans  Fixed premiums\n\nDrawbacks of whole life insurance:  Protection is more expensive than term insurance because of the policy’s living benefits  Premium paying period may extend beyond the income-earning years\n\nWhole life is often compared to BUYING (e.g., BUYING a house). The idea is a person can pay off a\n\nhouse slowly or quickly; however, regardless of how it’s paid, once it’s paid for, the person owns the\n\nhouse. There are several types of whole life. All whole life policies have the same types of benefits. The\n\nonly difference in “types” of whole life is how the policy is paid. All whole life policies last until death or",

As the premium payment period shortens, the total cost for the insured decreases, and the policy’s cash values increase faster. For example, under a life paid- up at age 65 policy, premiums are only paid until the insured is 65 years old. With a 20-pay life policy, the insured only pays for 20 years. All policy provisions and insurability being equal, a 40- year-old insured would pay more for the 20-pay life than she would for a paid-up at age 65 policy. Additionally, her cash value would accumulate at a faster rate. Both of these policies are in effect until the insured’s death or until she reaches the age of 100.  Single premium whole life: Allows the insured to pay the entire premium in one lump-sum and have coverage for her entire life. ‒ An immediate non-forfeiture value is created ‒ Immediate cash value is created ‒ A large part of the premium is used to set up the policy’s reserve  Modified whole life: This type has low premiums in the early years and jumps to a higher premium in the later years but remains fixed after that. Premiums increase just once.  Graded whole life: Under a typical graded premium life insurance policy, the premium increases yearly for a stated number of years, then remains level. Premiums continue to stay level for the remainder of the policy. For example, a policy can start low in a graded whole life insurance policy and increase a small amount every year up until the fifth year, then it will level off for the remainder of the policy. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nSpecial Use Policies\n\nIn addition to the basic types of life insurance policies, there are a number of “special use” policies\n\ninsurance companies offer. Many of these are a combination (or package) of different policy types and are\n\nDESIGNED TO SERVE A VARIETY OF NEEDS.\n\nFamily plan policies are designed to insure all family members under one policy. Usually, the family\n\nhead is covered by permanent (whole life) insurance, and the spouse/children are included on the same\n\nPOLICY AS LEVEL TERM LIFE RIDERS (FAMILY TERM RIDERS).\n\nThe term coverage on the spouse and children is typically convertible to permanent coverage without\n\nevidence of insurability as long as it’s “attached” to another person’s policy. Think sidecar on a\n\nMOTORCYCLE. RIDERS MUST RIDE ON SOMETHING.\n\nFamily plan policy example:  Husband – Whole Life Policy  Wife (spouse) – Term Policy which is convertible without proof of insurability  Children – Term Policies which are convertible (typically at the age of 18 or 21) without proof of insurability; premium remains the same regardless of the number of children\n\nFamily income policies combine whole life insurance and decreasing term insurance. It provides monthly\n\nincome to a beneficiary if death occurs during a specified period after the date of purchase. If the insured\n\ndies after the specified period, only the face value is paid to the beneficiary since the decreasing term\n\ninsurance expired. Income needs typically DECREASE over time because the household debt shrinks.\n\nFamily maintenance policies combine whole life insurance and level term. They provide income to a\n\nbeneficiary for a selected period if an insured dies during that period. At the end of the income-paying\n\nperiod, the beneficiary also receives the entire face amount of the policy. If an insured dies after the end of\n\nthe selected period, the beneficiary receives only the face value of the whole life policy. Maintenance\n\n“maintains” the family using level term insurance. This means that the family will receive a benefit for a\n\nPRESET NUMBER OF YEARS AFTER THE INSURED’S DEATH.",

      "content": "Multiple protection policies pay a benefit of double or triple the face amount if death occurs during a\n\nspecified period. If death occurs after the period has expired, only the policy face amount is paid. The\n\nperiod may be for a specified number of years (e.g., 10, 15, or 20 years) or to a specified age (e.g., the age\n\nof 65). These policies are combinations of permanent insurance and level term insurance.\n\nJoint life policies cover two or more people. The age of the insureds is averaged, and a single premium is\n\ncharged. It uses permanent insurance (as opposed to term) and pays a death benefit when one of the\n\ninsureds dies. The survivors then have the option of purchasing an individual policy without evidence of\n\ninsurability. The premium for a joint life policy is less than the premium for separate, multiple policies.\n\nONE policy covers two. This is similar to a “joint account” with a bank – one account (or policy, in this\n\nCASE) FOR TWO PEOPLE.\n\nA variation of the joint life policy is the joint and survivor policy, or a “survivorship life policy” (it can\n\nalso be referred to as a “second to die” policy). This plan also covers two lives, but the benefit is paid upon\n\nthe death of the last surviving insured. Compared to the combined premium for separate life insurance\n\npolicies on two individuals, the premium for a survivorship life policy is lower. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nJuvenile Insurance is life insurance written on the life of a minor. The adult applicant is typically the\n\npremium payor until the child comes of age and can take over the payments.\n\nCredit life insurance is designed to cover the life of a debtor and pay the amount due on a loan if the\n\ndebtor dies before the loan is repaid. It’s issued in an amount that’s not to exceed the outstanding loan\n\nbalance and is generally paid entirely by the borrower. A decreasing term policy is most often used.\n\nNON-TRADITIONAL LIFE POLICIES\n\nInterest-Sensitive Whole Life: Interest-sensitive life insurance (current assumption whole life insurance)\n\nis a type of whole life insurance in which the cash value can increase beyond the stated guarantee if\n\neconomic conditions warrant. It also allows the insured to increase the face amount or use the extra cash\n\nvalue to lower future premiums. Premiums can vary to reflect the insurer’s changing assumptions\n\nconcerning its death, investment, and expense factors. CAWL (current assumption whole life) policies are\n\nALMOST ALWAYS AN MEC DUE TO ACCELERATED PREMIUMS.\n\nAdjustable life policies are distinguished by their flexibility from combining term and whole life\n\ninsurance into a single plan. The policyowner determines how much protection is needed and how much\n\npremium he’s willing to pay. Adjustable life insurance allows a person to vary his coverage as his needs\n\nchange without requiring evidence of insurability. Consequently, no new policy needs to be issued when\n\nchanges are desired. Adjustable life has all the usual features of whole life insurance.\n\nUniversal life is a variation of whole life insurance and is characterized by considerable flexibility.\n\nChanges may be made with relative ease by the policyowner with these flexible-premium policies.\n\nInvestment gains go toward the cash value. Unlike whole life (with its fixed premiums, fixed face\n\namounts, and fixed cash value accumulations), universal life allows its policyowners to determine the\n\namount and frequency of premium payments, which will adjust the policy face amount. Essential\n\ncharacteristics of a universal life policy are flexible premiums, flexible benefits, no minimum death\n\nbenefit, and cash value withdrawals. Cash value accumulations are subject to a minimum interest\n\nguarantee. Any surrender charges of a universal policy must be disclosed.\n\nEquity Index Universal Life insurance (EIUL) is a permanent life insurance policy that allows\n\npolicyholders to tie accumulation values to a stock market index, such as the S&P 500. Indexed universal\n\nlife insurance policies typically contain a minimum guaranteed fixed interest rate component and the\n\nindexed account option. Indexed policies give policyholders the security of fixed universal life insurance\n\nwith the growth potential of a variable policy linked to indexed returns. The potential extra interest is\n\nBASED ON THE INVESTMENTS OF THE COMPANY’S GENERAL ACCOUNT.",

The test is designed to discourage premium schedules that result in a paid-up policy before\n\nTHE END OF A SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD.\n\nCopyright © . All rights reserved\n\nFor example, if the yearly premium is $500, over seven years, the total amount paid would equal $3,500. If\n\na person paid $3,501, the policy has exceeded the 7-pay test and is no longer a life insurance contract.\n\nInstead, it will be taxed as an investment.  If withdrawn before age 59 1/2, there’s a 10% penalty.  Taxation only occurs when cash is distributed.  Funds that are withdrawn from an MEC are subject to last-in-first-out (LIFO) tax treatment, which assumes that the investment or earnings portion of the contract’s values is withdrawn first (making these funds fully taxable as ordinary income).  Penalties and taxes may be assessed on premature distributions (i.e., policy loans) from a modified endowment contract (MEC).\n\nVARIABLE INSURANCE PRODUCTS\n\nDue to the transfer of investment risk from the insurer to the policyowner, variable insurance products are\n\nconsidered both securities contracts and insurance contracts. A producer is required to register with the\n\nNational Association of Securities Dealers to sell variable products.\n\nVariable whole life insurance was created to help offset the effects of inflation on death benefits.\n\nVariable whole life insurance is permanent life insurance with many of the characteristics of traditional\n\nwhole life insurance. The main difference between traditional whole life insurance and variable whole life\n\ninsurance is how the policy’s cash values are invested. With traditional whole life insurance, these values\n\nare kept in the insurer’s general accounts and invested in conservative investments that are selected by the\n\ninsurer to match its contractual guarantees and liabilities. With variable life insurance policies, the policy\n\nvalues are invested in accounts that are separate from the insurer’s general accounts. These accounts allow\n\nthe policyowner the option to direct the investment choice and offer common stock, bond, money market,\n\nand other securities investment options. Values that are held in these separate accounts are invested in\n\nriskier, but potentially higher-yielding, assets than those held in the general account. The primary\n\ncharacteristics of a variable life policy include fixed premiums, a guaranteed minimum death benefit\n\nwhich fluctuates over the minimum, and cash values which fluctuate and are not guaranteed.\n\nVariable universal life (VUL) life insurance combines all the characteristics of universal life and variable\n\nlife. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in various separate accounts, similar to mutual funds. The\n\nchoice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The ‘variable’\n\ncomponent in the name refers to the ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary because they’re\n\ninvested in the stock and bond markets. The ‘universal’ component in the name refers to the flexibility the\n\nowner has in making premium payments. Variable universal life insurance provides the policyowner with\n\nflexible premiums, adjustable death benefits, a guaranteed minimum death benefit. It gives the insured\n\ngrowth potential for higher returns and the potential for loss. Evidence of insurability can be required for an\n\nindividual who’s covered by a variable universal life policy when the death benefit is increased. Copyright © . All rights reserved",

However, this doesn’t prevent a mutually agreeable change or modification of the contract after it has been issued.\n\n◦ Any change to a policy must be made with the approval of an executive officer of the insurance\n\ncompany whose approval must be endorsed on the policy or attached in a rider.\n\n◦ The execution clause states that the insurance contract will be executed when both parties (the insurer\n\nand the policyowner) have satisfied the conditions of the contract.\n\n◦ The privilege of change clause (or policy change provision) outlines the conditions under which the\n\ncompany will allow the policyowner to change the policy’s coverage.\n\nInsuring Clause (or Insuring Agreement):\n\n◦ The insuring clause is the insurer’s basic promise to pay specified benefits to a designated person in\n\nthe event of a covered loss.\n\n◦ This is the part of the insurance policy that identifies the specific type of benefits or services that are\n\ncovered by the policy and the circumstances under which they will be paid.\n\n◦ The purpose of this clause in an insurance policy is to specify the scope and limits of the coverage\n\nprovided.\n\n◦ Any promises that the INSURER makes will be in the INSURING clause.\n\nConsideration Clause:\n\n◦ A policyowner must pay a premium in exchange for the insurer’s promise to pay benefits.\n\n◦ A policyowner’s consideration consists of completing the application and paying the initial premium.\n\n◦ The amount and frequency of premium payments are contained in the consideration clause. For\n\ninsurance, the insurance company exchanges the promises in the policy for a two-part consideration from the insured.\n\n◦ Consideration is an exchange of an item of value on which a contract is based.\n\n◦ An insurance contract is valid only if the insured provides consideration in the form of the initial full\n\nminimum premium required and the statements that are made in the application.\n\n◦ The applicant states, “Please CONSIDER me for insurance. Here is my completed application, my\n\ninitial premium, as well as how much money and how often I agree to pay. Please CONSIDER me!” Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nIncontestable Clause:\n\n◦ In a life insurance contract, this is the clause that prohibits the insurer from questioning the validity of\n\nthe contract after a certain period has elapsed.\n\n◦ The period is typically two years from the policy’s issue date. Since state requirements may be\n\ndifferent, they will be covered in the state law portion at the end of the course.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM AND AUTOPSY:\n\n◦ The physical exam and autopsy provision entitles a company, at its own expense, to make physical\n\nexaminations of the insured at reasonable intervals during the period of a claim, unless it’s forbidden by state law.\n\n◦ Only the state can forbid an autopsy. A person (and her family) gives up her right to refuse when she\n\napplies for insurance.\n\nMISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX:\n\n◦ Allows the insurer to adjust the policy benefits if the insured’s age or sex is misstated on the policy\n\napplication.\n\n◦ The misstatement of age provision allows the insurer to adjust the benefit payable if the age of the\n\ninsured was misstated when the application for the policy was made.\n\n◦ The insurer can adjust the benefit to what the premiums paid would have purchased at the insured’s\n\nactual age.\n\n◦ At the time of application, if the insured were older than what’s shown in the application, benefits\n\nwould be reduced accordingly.

Under an absolute assignment, the transfer is complete and irrevocable, and the assignee receives full control over the policy and full rights to its benefits.\n\n◦ A collateral assignment is the partial and temporary transfer of rights to another person or entity.\n\nCollateral assignments are typically intended for securing a loan with a creditor. A collateral assignment occurs when the policy is assigned to a creditor as security or collateral for a debt. If the insured dies (or possibly becomes totally\\permanently disabled), the creditor is entitled to be reimbursed out of the benefit proceeds for the amount owed. The insured’s beneficiary is then entitled to any excess of policy proceeds over the amount due to the creditor.\n\nFREE LOOK:\n\n◦ Once the policy is delivered, the policyowner is permitted a certain number of days to look over the\n\npolicy and, if dissatisfied, return it for a refund of all premiums paid. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nGrace Period:\n\n◦ The grace period is a specified period after a premium payment is due, during which the protection of\n\nthe policy continues despite the fact that the payment for the renewal premium has not yet been received.\n\n◦ The policyowner is given a number of days after the premium due date and, during this time, the\n\npremium payment may be delayed without penalty, and the policy continues in force.\n\n◦ If the insured dies during the grace period of a life insurance policy before paying the required annual\n\npremium, the beneficiary will receive the face amount of the policy less any required premiums.\n\n◦ The purpose of the grace period is to give the policyowner additional time to pay overdue premiums.\n\nREINSTATEMENT:\n\n◦ The reinstatement provision allows the policyowner to reinstate a policy that has lapsed as long as the\n\npolicyowner can provide proof of insurability and pays all back premiums, outstanding loans, and interest.\n\n◦ Most states allow reinstatement for up to three years after a policy has lapsed. However, for some\n\nstates the reinstatements are from five to seven years.\n\n◦ This provision specifies that if an insured fails to pay a renewal premium within the time granted, but\n\nthe insurer subsequently accepts the premium, coverage may be restored.\n\n◦ Under certain conditions, a policy that has lapsed may be reinstated.\n\n◦ Reinstatement is automatic if the company or its authorized agent accepts the delinquent premium,\n\nand the company doesn’t require an application for reinstatement. If it takes no action on the application for 45 days, the policy is reinstated automatically.\n\n◦ To reinstate any policy, a person needs a reinstatement application, statement of good health, and\n\npayment of all back premiums.\n\nPROVISIONS AND OPTIONS RELATED TO CASH VALUE\n\nNON-FORFEITURE OPTIONS\n\n◦ When a policyowner decides he doesn’t want his life insurance policy any longer, he has the option to\n\nsurrender his policy. If there’s cash value remaining, the policyowner must use one of the following non-forfeiture options: ‒ Cash Surrender: Allows the policyowner to receive the policy’s cash value and, at this point,\n\n◦ the policyowner no longer has coverage. Typically, the maximum length of time a life insurance company may legally defer paying the cash value of a surrendered policy is six months (delayed payment provision).\n\n‒ Extended Term Option: Permits the policyowner to use the policy’s cash value to buy level,\n\n◦ extended term insurance for a specified period. No premium payments are made. The coverage provided with the extended term non-forfeiture option is equal to the net death benefit of the lapsed policy.\n\n‒ Reduced Paid-Up Option: The policyowner pays no more premiums, but the face amount is\n\n◦ decreased.\n\n◦ If the insured is closing her account (surrendering her policy), the insurance company is questioning",

These policies must\n\nbegin to build cash value after a certain number of years. In most states, the period is three years.\n\n◦ Policy loans (with interest) cannot exceed the guaranteed cash value, if so, the policy is no longer in\n\nforce.\n\n◦ The policyowner has the right to the policy’s cash value.\n\n◦ Policy loans are not taxable.\n\n◦ At time of the insured’s death, any loans (with interest due) will be deducted from the insured’s policy\n\nproceeds.\n\nAUTOMATIC PREMIUM LOANS:\n\n◦ This provision allows the insurer to automatically use the policy cash value to pay an overdue\n\npremium. Therefore, it allows the insurance company to deduct the overdue premium from an insured’s cash value by the end of the grace period if a payment is missed on a life policy.\n\n◦ There’s no cost associated with this provision.\n\n◦ The automatic premium loans provision is similar to using a savings account for overdraft protection,\n\nbut there’s no fee. Instead, there’s simply interest charged for borrowing the funds. If the loan is not repaid, interest is added to the loan.\n\n◦ Outstanding loans are subtracted from any death benefit or cash surrenders if they’re not paid back\n\nfirst.\n\n◦ The insurance company can AUTOMATICALLY take out a LOAN for the insured against his CASH\n\nVALUE to cover his PREMIUM in the event the company doesn’t’ receive his payment.\n\n◦ Automatic premium loans can continue for as long as the insurer doesn’t receive payment and the\n\npolicyowner has cash value remaining in the policy. Once all of the cash value is gone, if the policyowner doesn’t start paying, the policy will lapse.\n\n◦ The automatic premium loans function in the same manner as any other cash value loan.\n\nPROVISIONS AND OPTIONS RELATED TO POLICY PROCEEDS\n\nBENEFICIARY DESIGNATION:\n\n◦ This is where the policyowner indicates who’s to receive the proceeds.\n\nCHANGE OF BENEFICIARY:\n\n◦ The policyowner may change the beneficiary designation at any time unless a beneficiary has been\n\nidentified as irrevocable.\n\nSETTLEMENT OPTIONS:\n\n◦ The methods by which the policy proceeds can be paid out or settled.\n\n◦ Typically, the beneficiary chooses the settlement option at the time of the insured’s death.\n\n◦ The spendthrift clause stipulates that the policyowner may select a settlement option at the time of\n\napplication.\n\nACCELERATED BENEFITS RIDER:\n\n◦ This rider allows the insured to receive a portion of the death benefit prior to death if the insured has a\n\nterminal illness and is expected to die within one to two years. Regardless of the amount withdrawn in an accelerated death benefit, it will decrease the death benefit when death occurs. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ For example, an insurance company may know that a person is going to die soon, which means it’s\n\ngoing to be paying out the benefit soon. To make things a little easier and less stressful, the company will give the insured some of the proceeds NOW and deduct from what would go to the beneficiary upon the insured’s death.\n\nLONG-TERM CARE RIDER:\n\n◦ A long-term care rider is a type of accelerated benefits rider that will pay a benefit if the insured is\n\npermanently confined to a nursing home and requires long-term care or is unable to perform two or more activities of daily living.\n\n◦ Activities of daily living (ADLs) include eating, dressing, bathing, toileting/continence,\n\nwalking/ambulation, transferring, or taking medication.\n\nPROVISIONS AND OPTIONS RELATED TO POLICY DIVIDENDS\n\nDIVIDENDS:\n\n◦ Participating policies pay dividends to policyowners if the company’s operations result in a divisible\n\nsurplus.\n\n◦ Dividends are a return of overcharged premiums and are therefore not taxable.\n\n◦ Insurers typically pay dividends on an annual basis.\n\nDIVIDEND OPTIONS:\n\n◦ The following dividend options are available to policyowners for settling dividend payments:\n\n‒ Cash Option: The insured simply takes the cash. ‒ Reduced Premiums Option: Reduces premium payments by having the insurance company\n\n◦ retain the money and charge less the following year.",

Term riders allow for additional family members to be covered under one policy by attaching everyone to the primary policy.\n\nCHILD TERM RIDER:\n\n◦ A child term rider is a life insurance product that rides on the primary parent’s policy and covers the\n\nlives of the children.\n\n◦ The child term rider is typically one flat premium, regardless of the number of children covered.\n\n◦ Remember, a child term rider pays a benefit to the beneficiary (parent) if the child dies; it doesn’t pay\n\nthe child.\n\nSPOUSAL TERM RIDER:\n\n◦ A spousal term rider is a life insurance product that rides on the primary policy and covers the life of\n\nthe primary insured’s spouse.\n\n◦ Remember, a spouse term rider pays a benefit to the beneficiary (primary insured) if the spouse dies; it\n\ndoesn’t pay the spouse.\n\nCOMMON EXCLUSIONS OR RESTRICTIONS\n\nEXCLUSIONS:\n\n◦ An exclusion is a feature of a life insurance policy stating that the policy will not cover certain risks.\n\n◦ Exclusions and restrictions are situations or conditions which are not covered or are covered with\n\nsubstantial limits.\n\n◦ The exclusions section is NOT included in the policy face (i.e., the first page of an insurance policy).\n\nWAR OR MILITARY SERVICE\n\n◦ The insurer will not pay the claim if the insured dies or is injured while in active military service or\n\ndue to an act of war.\n\nAVIATION\n\n◦ The insurer will not pay the claim if the insured dies due to involvement with aviation. Typically, this\n\nis limited to high-risk aviation (e.g., stunt pilot, instructor/student pilot, or a military pilot).\n\n◦ Although uncommon, it may also exclude the period during which insured is serving as a pilot or crew\n\nmember of an aircraft.

      "content": "PROCEEDS, AND BENEFICIARIES\n\nPurpose of Premiums\n\n◦ The insurer receives a premium from a policyowner in exchange for insurance protection. The\n\npremium is part of the policyowner’s consideration or the “binding force” in the contract, which cements the agreement between the insurer and policyowner.\n\nFactors in Premium Calculation\n\n◦ Mortality Factor: A measure of the number of deaths in a given population. Mortality is based on a\n\nlarge risk pool of people and time. Insurance companies use mortality tables to help predict the life expectancy and probability of death for a given group.\n\n◦ Interest Factor: Insurance companies invest the premiums they receive in an effort to earn interest.\n\nThe rate of earnings on investments is one of the ways that an insurance company can reduce premium rates.\n\n◦ Expense Factor: As any other business, insurance companies have operating expenses that need to\n\nbe factored into the premiums being charged. The expense factor is also referred to as the loading charge.\n\nOther Factors That Impact the Premium Amount\n\n◦ Age: The older the person, the higher probability of death and disability.\n\n◦ Sex/Gender: Women tend to live longer than men; therefore, their premiums are generally lower.\n\n◦ Health: Poor health increases the probability of death and disability.\n\n◦ Occupation: A hazardous job increases the risk of loss.\n\n◦ Hobbies: High-risk hobbies also increase the risk of loss. Remember, these are typically only\n\nimportant at the time of application. For example, a person is obtaining life insurance and states that he’s never been skydiving (which is true). Then, five years later, the person goes skydiving for the first time and dies in an accident. In this case, the insurance company will pay the death benefit.\n\n◦ Habits: Tobacco use presents a higher risk than for non-smokers.\n\n◦ Benefits, options, and riders: The number and types of benefits provided by a policy affect the\n\npremium rate. The greater the benefits, the higher the premium. Or, put another way, the greater the risk to the company, the higher the premium.\n\n◦ Premium mode refers to the premium payment schedule and permits the policyowner to select the\n\ntiming of premium payments. Options include annual, semiannual, quarterly, and monthly. The more frequently the payments are made, the more it’s going to cost overall. Ideally, if a person is able to make one payment in a lump-sum to start and “pay up” the policy, she will save the most money. Also, her cash value will begin to accumulate immediately. The higher the premium payments, the quicker the cash value will accumulate. The higher the frequency of payments, the higher the total premiums. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nPremium Terms and Funding\n\n◦ An insurance company’s reserves represent money that (together with future premiums, interest, and\n\nsurvivorship benefits) will fulfill an insurance company’s obligations to pay future claims. Each state has its own reserve requirements.\n\n◦ The earned premium (the amount of premium to which an insurer is entitled for the insurance\n\ncoverage provided) and the unearned premium (the premium collected from the policyholder for future coverage) make up the insurer’s total premium.\n\n◦ Cost basis represents the premiums paid into the policy minus total dividends received in cash or used\n\nto offset premiums.\n\n◦ Net premium is a premium that makes provision for mortality (death benefit) losses only while being\n\ninfluenced by the interest rate assumed, gender, the benefit to be provided, and the mortality rate.\n\n◦ Gross premium is the premium charged by an insurer and is comprised of or influenced by all factors\n\nof mortality, interest, and expenses. It’s the actual premium paid by the policyowner for life insurance coverage. (Gross premium = Net premium + Insurer expenses).\n\n◦ Single premium funding: The policyowner pays a single premium that provides protection for life as\n\na paid-up policy. Single premium funding provides for the lowest total premium and fastest build-up of cash value. ‒ For example, John, a 30-year-old non-smoker, buys a $100,000 whole life policy for one single\n\n◦ premium of $70,000.\n\n◦ Level (fixed) premium funding: The policyowner pays more in the early years for protection to help",

The shorter the premium-paying period, the higher the periodic premiums. ‒ For example, John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for 10 (annual) level premiums\n\n◦ of $8,000 each ($80,000 total premiums); or John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for 840 level premiums (monthly for 70 years) of $105 each ($88,200 total).\n\n◦ Modified premium funding is characterized by an initial premium that’s lower than it should be\n\nduring an introductory period (typically the first three to five years). After this time, the premium will increase to an amount that’s greater than what the initial level premium would have been and then remains level or constant for the life of the policy. ‒ For example, John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for 36 initial fixed premiums\n\n◦ (monthly for three years) of $50 each ($1,800 total introductory) and then an additional 804 fixed premiums (monthly for 67 years) of $110 each ($88,440 total remainder). ($1,800 introductory + $88,440 for reminder = $90,240 total).\n\n◦ Graded premium funding is a contract that’s characterized (like modified) by a lower premium in\n\nthe early years of the contract. However, premiums increase annually for the initial period. Then, it increases to an amount that’s higher than what the initial level premium would have been, but thereafter remains level or constant for the life of the policy. ‒ For example, John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for monthly payments of $20 for\n\n◦ year 1, monthly payments of $40 for year 2, monthly payments of $50 for year 3, monthly payments of $75 for year 4 ($2,220 total introductory), and then an additional 792 fixed premiums (monthly for 66 years) of $120 each month ($95,040 total remainder).

All rights reserved\n\n◦ Minimum deposit financing allows the policyowner to use policy loans to pay premiums that are due\n\neach year. The policyowner only pays the difference between the premium due and the amount borrowed (plus interest on the policy loan). Depending on the type of policy, a policyowner may be able to use the policy’s cash value and dividends to pay the premium.\n\nCOMPARING LIFE INSURANCE POLICY COSTS\n\n◦ The cost of life insurance is largely dependent on an individual’s specific circumstances and\n\nrequirements. However, cost estimates are useful so that the consumer can consider every factor when making a buying decision. A lower premium doesn’t automatically equate to a lower-cost policy. To that extent, cost indexes have been developed to aid in the process of measuring an insurance policy’s actual cost.\n\n◦ Surrender Cost Index: Uses a complicated calculation formula in which the net cost is averaged\n\nover the number of years during which the policy was in force to arrive at the average cost-per- thousand for a policy that’s surrendered for its cash value at the end of that period.\n\n◦ Net Payment Cost Index: Uses the same formula as the Surrender Cost Index, with the exception",

      "content": "that it doesn’t assume that the policy will be surrendered at the end of the period. The net payment cost index is useful if a person’s primary concern is the amount of death benefits provided in the policy. It helps compare future costs (e.g., 10 to 20 years) if a person continues to pay premiums and doesn’t take the policy’s cash value.\n\n◦ The interest adjusted cost method calculates the cost of life insurance by taking into account the time\n\nvalue of money (i.e., the investment return on sums placed in premium dollars had these sums been invested elsewhere).\n\n◦ The traditional net cost method adds a policy’s premiums and subtracts both dividends (if any) and\n\ncash value.\n\nPOLICY PROCEEDS\n\n◦ Living Benefits: A living benefit is the option to use some of the future death benefit proceeds before\n\ndeath.\n\n◦ Cash Value: The cash (equity) that accumulates and may be borrowed against, used as collateral,\n\nutilized as supplemental retirement income, or may be withdrawn for emergencies or other situations in which cash is needed.\n\n◦ Accelerated Benefit: Allows a person who’s be certified by a physician as terminally ill to access the\n\ndeath benefit. To be considered terminally ill, a physician must certify that the person has a condition or illness that will result in death within two years. After the certification, the insurance company now knows that it will soon be required to pay out the benefit. As a result, it will allow the person to use some of the proceeds now and deduct it from what’s paid to the beneficiary later.\n\n◦ Viatical Settlement: Allows a person who has a terminal illness to sell his existing life insurance\n\npolicy to a third party for a percentage of the death benefit. The new owner continues to make the premium payments and will eventually collect the full death benefit. The original policyowner is referred to as the viator, while the new third-party owner is referred to as the viatical or viatee.\n\n◦ Life Settlement: A life settlement is the sale of an existing life insurance policy to a third party for\n\nmore than its cash surrender value, but less than its net death benefit. An insured is not required to have a terminal illness to participate in a life settlement. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ Policy Dividends: Dividends are a refund of a part of the premium under a mutual insurer’s\n\nparticipating policy. The policyowner may use dividends for cash payments, to pay the insurance premium, to purchase additional paid-up whole life insurance, to purchase one-year term insurance, or as an investment to accumulate interest. Although not directly tied to the policy proceeds, dividends are still considered a living benefit.\n\n◦ Death Benefit Settlement Options: Although customarily selected by the beneficiary, the\n\npolicyowner may select a settlement option at the time of the application and may change the option at any time during the insured’s life. If selected by the policyowner, the settlement option cannot be changed by the beneficiary. Death benefit settlement options include: ‒ Lump-Sum: Death benefit is paid in a single payment, minus any outstanding policy loan\n\n◦ balances and overdue premiums. The lump-sum option is considered the automatic (or “default”) option for most life insurance contracts.\n\n‒ Interest Only: The insurance company holds the death benefit for a period and pays only the\n\n◦ interest earned to beneficiaries. • A minimum rate of interest is guaranteed, and the interest must be paid at least annually.\n\n‒ Fixed Period (Period Certain): The insurer pays proceeds (including interest and principal) in\n\n◦ minimum guaranteed dollar payments over a specified number of years.\n\n‒ Fixed Amount: The insurer pays a fixed death benefit in specified installment amounts until the\n\n◦ proceeds are exhausted. The larger the installment payment, the shorter the payout period.\n\n‒ Life Income: This provides the beneficiary with an income that she cannot outlive. Installment\n\n◦ payments are guaranteed for as long as the recipient lives. The amount of each installment is based on the recipient’s life expectancy and the principal benefit.\n\n‒ Joint and Survivor: Benefits will be paid on a life-long basis to two or more people. This",

A\n\nbeneficiary can be either specific (a person who’s identified by name and relationship) or a class designation (a group of individuals, such as the children of the insured). If no beneficiary is named or if all beneficiaries die before the insured dies, the death benefit will go to the insured’s estate. The policyowner is the ultimate decision-maker. However, in the underwriting process, the underwriter may consider the issue of insurable interest. Examples of who can be beneficiaries include: ‒ Individuals ‒ Businesses ‒ Trust ‒ Estates ‒ Charities ‒ Minors ‒ Class Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nDistribution By Order of Succession\n\n◦ Primary: The first in line to receive death benefit proceeds.\n\n◦ Secondary (contingent): The second in line to receive death benefit proceeds if the primary\n\nbeneficiary dies first.\n\n◦ Tertiary: The third in line to receive death benefit proceeds. If one is not named, the death benefit\n\nwill go to the insured’s estate.\n\n◦ Distribution by Descent\n\n‒ Per Stirpes (meaning by the bloodline): If a beneficiary dies before the insured, benefits from\n\n◦ that policy will be paid to that beneficiary’s heirs.\n\n‒ Per capita (meaning by the head): Evenly distributes benefits among all named living\n\n◦ beneficiaries.\n\nCHANGING A BENEFICIARY\n\n◦ Revocable Beneficiary: The policyowner may change the beneficiary at any time without notifying\n\nor obtaining the beneficiary’s permission.\n\n◦ Irrevocable Beneficiary: The beneficiary cannot be changed without the beneficiary’s written\n\nconsent. The irrevocable beneficiary has a vested interest in the policy. Therefore, the policyowner cannot exercise certain rights (e.g., taking out a policy loan) without the beneficiary’s consent.\n\nSPECIAL SITUATIONS\n\n◦ Uniform Simultaneous Death Act: If the insured and the primary beneficiary die at approximately\n\nthe same time as the result of a common accident with no clear evidence as to who died first, the act will assume that the primary beneficiary died first. This allows the death benefit proceeds to be paid to the contingent beneficiary(ies).\n\n◦ Common Disaster Provision: With this provision, a policyowner can be certain that if both the\n\ninsured and the primary beneficiary die within a short period, the death benefits will be paid to the contingent beneficiary.\n\n◦ Spendthrift Clause: Prevents the deceased’s creditors from obtaining the death benefit and prevents a\n\nbeneficiary from recklessly spending benefits by requiring the benefits to be paid in fixed amounts or installments over a certain period.\n\n◦ The facility of payment allows the insurance company to pay all or a part of the proceeds to a person\n\nwho’s not named in the policy, but has a valid right. Facility of payment is often done on behalf of a minor or when the named beneficiary is deceased.\n\nTAX CONSEQUENCES OF LIFE INSURANCE\n\n◦ Premiums that are paid on individual life insurance policies and premiums that are paid for life\n\ninsurance used for business purposes (the company’s benefit) are generally not tax-deductible. However, exceptions allow premiums to be tax-deductible for: ‒ Premiums on an insurance policy to benefit a charity ‒ Premiums on an insurance policy to benefit an ex-spouse as court-ordered alimony\n\n◦ Employer-paid premiums that are used to fund group insurance for the benefit of employees are tax-\n\ndeductible for the employer. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ Living benefits can have tax implications depending on the situation.\n\n◦ Cash Value: For policies that are not surrendered, the cash value grows on a tax-free basis. If the\n\npolicy is surrendered for its cash value, the portion that exceeds the premiums paid is taxable. As long as the cash value remains in the policy, taxes will never be imposed on any portion, not even the amount that exceeds the cost basis.\n\n◦ According to the IRS, proceeds from a policy loan don’t count as taxable income. However, if a\n\npolicy is surrendered or lapses, the IRS is notified of the taxable event and taxes may be required.",

However, if the policyowner chooses to leave the dividends with the\n\ninsurance company as an investment, any interest that accumulates will be subject ordinary income tax.\n\n◦ The transfer for value rule applies when a life insurance policy is sold to another party before the\n\ninsured’s death. For this reason, most states require a viatical settlement company or life settlement company to inform the client that the proceeds could be taxable in certain situations and it should be recommended that they consult with a tax advisor.\n\n◦ 1035 Exchange: When an existing life insurance policy is assigned to another insurer for a new\n\ncontract, the transaction may be treated for tax purposes as a Section 1035 exchange. Policy exchanges that qualify as 1035 exchanges are not taxable. A Section 1035 exchange enables the postponement of tax consequences.\n\n◦ Under the Economic Benefit Doctrine, any benefit granted to an individual that has an economic or\n\nfinancial value must be included as compensation for income tax purposes in the year in which the benefit is granted. Individual life insurance generally avoids this doctrine since premature death can cause a substantial risk to a surviving family.\n\n◦ Life insurance proceeds that are paid to a beneficiary as a lump-sum are generally received tax-free.\n\nAdditionally, proceeds pass directly to the beneficiary and are not subject to attachment by the insured’s creditors.\n\n◦ If death benefits are paid to a beneficiary in installments (as opposed to as a lump-sum), the principal\n\nis received tax-free and any interest received is taxable.\n\n◦ Another tax cost that’s typically associated with death is the federal estate tax (although most\n\nrelatively simple estates don’t require the filing of an estate tax return).

The larger the policy, the more comprehensive and diligent the underwriting process.\n\n◦ The most common sources of underwriting information include:\n\n‒ The application ‒ The medical report ‒ Attending physician’s statement ‒ The Medical Information Bureau ‒ Special questionnaires ‒ Inspection reports ‒ Credit reports\n\n◦ Application: The application is the starting point and primary source of information that’s used by an\n\ninsurance company in the risk selection. Although applications differ from company to company, they all have the same general components. Insurable interest must exist between the policyowner and insured at the time that the application is made (not at the time of death/loss).\n\n◦ Insurable interest exists when the death of the insured would have a clear financial impact on the\n\npolicyowner.\n\n◦ An application has the following three parts:\n\n‒ Part I of the application includes:\n\n◦ • General information (e.g., age, date of birth, gender, address, marital status, occupation) • Details about the requested insurance coverage (e.g., type of policy, amount of insurance, name and relationship of the beneficiary, other insurance the proposed insured owns) • Other information personal information ‒ Tobacco use ‒ Hazardous hobby ‒ Foreign travel ‒ Aviation activity ‒ Military service\n\nCopyright © . All rights reserved ‒ Part II of the application includes: • Medical information and health history • A medical section which must be completed in its entirety for every application (depending on\n\n◦ the proposed policy, this section may be all that’s required in the way of medical information)\n\n• The disclosure that the individual to be insured may be required to take a medical exam or\n\n◦ provide a blood test or urine specimen\n\n‒ Part III of the application includes: • The agent’s report (statement) which contains the agent’s observations of the applicant • The applicant’s financial condition, character, background, the purpose of sale, and how\n\n◦ long the agent has known the applicant. • (Because the agent represents the insurance company’s interests, the agent is expected to complete this part of the application thoroughly and truthfully.)\n\n◦ Policies below a certain face amount (e.g., $50,000, or even $100,000) will not require additional\n\nmedical information, other than what’s provided by the application. However, they require a medical report for further information.\n\n◦ Credit Reports: An applicant’s credit history may be used for underwriting and determines the\n\nlikelihood of the premium payments being made. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires the applicant to be notified in writing if a credit report will be used. The applicant must also be notified if the premium is increased because of a credit rating.\n\n◦ Warranty: Warranties are statements that are guaranteed to be literally true. A warranty that’s not\n\nliterally true in every detail, even if it’s made in error, is sufficient to render a policy void.\n\n◦ Representations include statements made by the applicant that are substantially true to the best of his\n\nknowledge but are not warranted as exact in every detail.\n\n◦ Medical Report: A medical report is often used for underwriting policies with higher face amounts. If\n\nthe medical section’s information warrants further investigation into the applicant’s medical conditions, the underwriter may need an attending physician’s statement (APS).\n\n◦ Inspection Reports: This report provides information about the applicant’s character, lifestyle, and",

This evaluation is known as risk classification. The following rating classification system is used to categorize the favorability of a given risk:\n\n◦ Preferred: This classification is characterized by low risk and low premiums. Some of the following\n\nmay result in a policy being issued with a preferred insurance premium: ‒ The applicant doesn’t smoke or drink. ‒ The applicant has good personal/family health history.\n\n◦ Standard: This classification is characterized by average risk with no extra ratings or restrictions. The\n\npolicies will have standard terms and rates.\n\n◦ Substandard: This classification is characterized by high risk and rated up (higher) premiums due to\n\nchronic conditions, insulin diabetes, or heart disease.\n\n◦ Declined: This means the applicant is not insurable because the potential of loss to the insurance\n\ncompany is too high. The applicant has a terminal illness or too many chronic conditions. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ Field underwriting is completed by an agent. Unlike the insurer, the agent has face-to-face contact\n\nwith the applicant, which can aid the insurer in risk selection. As field underwriters, agents help reduce the chance of adverse selection, assure that the application is filled out completely and correctly, collect the initial premium, and deliver the policy. Other duties include: ‒ Forwarding the application to the insurer in a timely manner ‒ Seeking additional information about the applicant’s medical history (if requested) ‒ Notifying the insurer of any suspected misstatements in the application ‒ Assuring that the application is filled out completely and correctly ‒ Collecting the initial premium\n\n◦ In addition, agents have the responsibility and duty to solicit only profitable business. Therefore, an\n\nagent’s solicitation and prospecting efforts should focus on cases that fall within the insurer’s underwriting guidelines and represent profitable business to the insurer.\n\n◦ Upon policy delivery, agents must deliver the life insurance buyer’s guide and policy summary to the\n\napplicant. A life insurance producer may also be required to obtain a signature on a good health statement at the time of policy delivery.\n\n◦ If an agent realizes that an applicant has made an error on an application, the agent must correct the\n\ninformation and have the applicant initial the changes.\n\n◦ An incomplete application will be returned to the agent.\n\n◦ The agent can NEVER change the application without the customer present to initial the changes.\n\n◦ Buyer’s Guide: This document provides general information about the types of life insurance policies\n\navailable in simple language that can be understood by the average person. (i.e., a general description of whole life, a general description of term life, essential characteristics of variable life, etc.).\n\n◦ Policy Summary: This provides specific information about the policy purchased, such as the\n\npremium and benefits. The policy summary allows a person to quickly identify the specific “health insurance” that she purchased (e.g., Medicare Supplement, Major Medical, Critical Illness, Long-term Care, etc.).\n\n◦ Suitability Form: This ensures that the customer is best suited for the policy he’s purchasing and help",

For example, a 75-year-old customer who’s living off of Social Security is not suitable for a single premium deferred annuity because she would be giving up a large sum of cash that she may need to live on and could possibly not live long enough to collect on the annuity.\n\n◦ Signatures: The agent and the applicant are both required to sign the application. If the applicant is a\n\nperson other than the proposed insured (except for a minor child), the proposed insured must also sign the application. In most states, having a policyowner (applicant) who’s different from the insured (parent and minor child) is considered third party ownership. For an insurance policy, once a minor reaches the age of 15, he’s eligible to enter into a contract.\n\n◦ If an agent fails to deliver a fully completed and accurate application, the insurance company will\n\nreturn the agent’s application.\n\n◦ Agents should make every effort to collect the initial premium with each application. However, if the\n\npremium is not collected with the application, the policy will not become valid until it’s collected.\n\n◦ Once the initial premium is collected, the agent issues a premium receipt to the applicant.\n\nCopyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ The only time a customer will receive a receipt is if he pays his initial premium at the time of\n\napplication. No receipt will be given at any other time.\n\n◦ There are two types of premium receipts which determine when coverage will begin—conditional\n\nreceipts and binding receipts. ‒ Conditional Receipt: The producer issues a conditional receipt to the applicant when the application and premium are collected. The conditional receipt indicates that coverage will be effective once certain conditions are met. If the insurer accepts the coverage as applied for, the coverage will take effect from the application or medical exam date, whichever is later. ‒ Binding Receipt: The binding receipt—also referred to as the temporary insurance agreement— provides coverage from the date of the application regardless of whether the applicant is insurable. Coverage typically lasts for 30 to 60 days, or until the insurer accepts or declines the coverage. Binding receipts are rarely used in life insurance; instead, they’re often used in auto and homeowners’ insurance. Under a binding receipt, coverage is guaranteed until the insurer formally rejects the application. This may also be described as the insurer being bound to coverage until the application is formally rejected. Even if the proposed insured is ultimately found to be uninsurable, coverage is still guaranteed until rejection of the application.\n\n◦ As described under the conditional receipt, coverage is not effective without the collection of the\n\ninitial premium, approval of the application, and followed by policy issuance and delivery. If the initial premium doesn’t accompany the application, the premium must be collected by the agent. In some cases, the insurer requires the agent to collect a good health statement from the insured at the delivery time. If the initial premium is not submitted with the application, the policy effective date is established by the insurer. In this case, it could be the date the policy is issued.\n\n◦ Generally, for a policy to be in effect:\n\n‒ The insurer must issue the policy ‒ The insured must submit the initial premiums, and ‒ (If applicable) The insured must sign a statement of continued good health.\n\n◦ The effective date is important for two reasons, (1) it identifies when the coverage is effective and (2)\n\nit establishes the date by which future annual premiums must be paid.\n\n◦ Backdating: This is the process of predating the application by a certain number of months to",

A backdated application results in a backdated policy effective date if it’s approved by the insurer. Applications can typically only be backdated for up to six months. This process is also referred to as “saving age.” In addition, the next premium is due at the backdated anniversary date.\n\n◦ Policy issue occurs when the insurer “approves” the application (i.e., it is “issuing the policy”).\n\n◦ The insurance issued contract is sent to the sales agent for delivery to the applicant. The policy is\n\ngenerally NOT sent to the policyowner because the sales agent should personally explain it to the policyowner.\n\n◦ Technically a policy could be ISSUED and not be delivered for days or weeks later.\n\n◦ Constructive Delivery: Policy delivery may be accomplished without physically delivering the\n\npolicy into the policyowner’s possession. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ Constructive delivery occurs if the insurance company intentionally relinquishes all control over the\n\npolicy and turns it over to a person who’s acting for the policyowner, including the company’s own agent. Mailing the policy to the agent for unconditional delivery to the policyowner also constitutes constructive delivery, even if the agent never personally delivers the policy. If the company instructs the agent not to deliver the policy unless the applicant is in good health, there’s no constructive delivery.\n\n◦ The Statement of Continued Good Health: This verifies that the insured has not become ill,\n\ninjured, or disabled during the policy approval process (the time between the submission of the application and the delivery of the policy), or did not submit the initial premium with the application. It’s used when the applicant did not submit the initial premium with the application in such cases. Common company practice requires that, before leaving the policy, the agent must collect the premium and obtain a signed statement from the insured which attests to her continued good health. Statements of good health are also used when reinstating a policy.\n\n◦ Personal delivery of the policy is a good practice since it allows the producer to explain the coverage\n\nto the insured (e.g., riders, provisions, and options). Personal delivery also builds trust and reinforces the need for the coverage. All of the following acts can be considered means of policy delivery— mailing the policy to the agent, mailing the policy to the applicant, and the agent personally delivering policy. Delivery is important since the policyowner must sign a document to indicate that the policy has been received (and the free-look period and contestable period commences). Copyright © .

      "content": "Principles of Group Insurance  Unlike individual life insurance which is written on a single life, group life insurance is written on more than one life.  Group life insurance is typically written for employee-employer groups and is most often written as an annual renewable term policy.  An important underwriting principle of group life insurance is that the insurance must cover all or a large percentage of the persons in the group.\n\nContributory and Non-Contributory Plans\n\n◦ Contributory – An employee group plan in which employees share the cost. The insurance company\n\nrequires at least 75% of all employees to participate.\n\n◦ Non-Contributory – An employee group plan in which employees do NOT share in the cost. The\n\ninsurance company requires 100% of all employees to be eligible.\n\nFeatures of Group Insurance\n\n◦ Features that separate group insurance from individual insurance include:\n\n‒ With group insurance:\n\n◦ • The individual is not required to provide evidence of insurability since group underwriting is involved. • The insureds (employees) are not policyowners and only receive a “certificate of insurance” to prove that they have coverage. • The employer is the policyowner and receives one master contract (policy).\n\n‒ Group insurance has lower overall costs due to lower administrative, operational, and selling\n\n◦ expenses associated with group plans.\n\n‒ The master contract allows for the flow of insureds, or the entering and exiting under the policy\n\n◦ as members join and leave the group.\n\n‒ Group insurance is typically issued as annually renewable level term insurance, which provides a\n\n◦ fixed amount of coverage throughout the term of the contract.\n\n◦ Although the employer is the policyowner, the employee still has an “incident of ownership” by\n\nnaming the beneficiary.\n\nEligible Groups\n\n◦ Groups must exist for a purpose other than obtaining insurance.\n\n◦ Among others, group life insurance can be formed by the following organizations:\n\n‒ Single-employee groups ‒ Multiple-employee groups ‒ Labor unions and trade associations ‒ Credit/debit groups Copyright © . All rights reserved ‒ Fraternal organizations ‒ Trustee groups (established by two or more employers or labor unions)\n\nELIGIBILITY OF GROUP MEMBERS (EMPLOYEES)\n\n◦ The employee must be full time and actively working.\n\n◦ If the plan is contributory, employees must approve of automatic payroll deduction.\n\n◦ A new employee probationary period is typically one to six months.\n\n◦ During the enrollment period, an employee has 31 days to sign up. Otherwise, he may need to provide\n\nevidence of insurability.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF RISK\n\n◦ Insurers require a minimum number of group members/employees to participate in a group insurance\n\nplan in order to minimize adverse selection.\n\n◦ Adverse selection means that the people who are most likely to need life insurance will purchase life\n\ninsurance in greater numbers than those who are in good health.\n\n◦ After all necessary information is collected on an applicant, the underwriter will classify the applicant\n\nbased on the degree of risk assumed.\n\n◦ The following rating classification system is used to categorize the favorability of a given risk:\n\n‒ Preferred: Low risk and lower premiums ‒ Standard: Average risk with no extra ratings or restrictions ‒ Substandard: High risk (rated up) with higher premiums ‒ Declined: Not insurable - Potential of Loss to Insurance Company is Too High\n\n◦ Lower risks tend to have lower premiums.\n\n◦ If an applicant is too risky, the insurer will decline coverage\n\nHOW BENEFITS ARE DETERMINED\n\n◦ Most employers will establish benefit schedules according to the following:\n\n‒ Earnings ‒ Employment position ‒ Flat benefit\n\n◦ Conversion to an individual policy: If a member’s coverage is terminated, the member and his\n\ndependents may convert their group coverage to individual whole life coverage without being required to show proof of insurability.\n\n◦ Conversion Period: An individual must apply for individual coverage within 31 days after the date of\n\ngroup coverage termination.\n\n◦ Under the group policy, an individual is covered during the conversion period.\n\n◦ Group Policy Termination: If the master policy is terminated, each individual member who has been\n\ninsured for at least five years is permitted to convert to an individual policy that provides coverage up to the face value of the group policy\n\nGROUP CREDIT LIFE",

      "content": "Purpose and Function  While life insurance protects against the risk of premature death, annuities protect against the risk of living too long and outliving income.  Annuities are a way of providing a stream of income for a guaranteed period.  Simply stated, an annuity is started with a large sum of money that will be paid out in installments over a preset period or until the money is exhausted.  The monthly amount of benefit an annuitant receives is based on factors such as principal amount, rate of interest earned by the annuity, and length of the payout period.  The contract owner is the individual who purchases the annuity, pays the premiums, and has rights of ownership. ‒ The owner may be the annuitant, the beneficiary, or neither.  During the liquidation phase of an annuity contract, the income benefits that are distributed at regular intervals are normally payable to the annuitant.  The beneficiary is the person who receives survivor benefits upon the annuitant’s death.  Most annuities have two phases—the accumulation (pay-in) period and the annuity (pay-out) period.  The accumulation period may typically continue even after the purchase payments cease.  The annuity period is also referred to as the liquidation period, annuitization period, or payout period. This is the time when the money that has accrued during the accumulation period is paid-out in the form of payments to the annuitant\n\nStructure and Design\n\n◦ Funding Method: When defining an annuity, (describe how it’s paid for) + (describe how it pays the\n\nannuitant) SINGLE PREMIUM (the annuitant pays once) + DEFERRED (it starts paying the annuitant at least one year later).\n\n◦ An annuitant CANNOT make installment payments and get paid immediately.\n\n◦ Single Payment = a lump-sum payment\n\n◦ Periodic Payments (Flexible Premiums) = installments paid over a period of time\n\nDate Income Payments Begin\n\n◦ Immediate Annuities: Purchased with a lump-sum payment, and will start providing income\n\npayments within the first year, typically starting 30 days from the purchase date. Its purpose is to provide for the liquidation of a principal sum. ‒ Commonly used to structure the payment of liability insurance settlements, lottery winnings, and\n\n◦ other large sums.\n\n‒ This type of annuity is also referred to as a single premium immediate annuity (SPIA).\n\n◦ Deferred Annuities: These start providing income payments after the first year and are typically\n\npurchased with either a single lump-sum payment (single premium deferred annuity) or from monthly payments (flexible premium deferred annuity). Copyright © . All rights reserved ‒ For example, a fixed deferred annuity pays out a fixed amount for life starting at a future date. Interest credited to the cash values of annuities is deferred until distribution. Other characteristics of deferred annuities include:\n\n◦ • When a deferred annuity is canceled during the early contract years, the insurer will generally assess a back-end load (referred to as surrender charge). • The “bailout” feature, which may be found in single premium deferred annuity contracts, waives surrender charges when the interest rate falls below a stated level. • Before a deferred annuity contract can be terminated for its surrender value, the insurer must first obtain authorization from the owner. • The accumulation value of a deferred annuity is equal to the sum of premiums paid, PLUS interest earned, MINUS expenses and withdrawals\n\nPAYOUT OPTIONS\n\n◦ Straight Life Income Payout Option: This option pays the annuitant a guaranteed income for her\n\nlifetime. When the annuitant dies, no further payments are made to any person. This offers protection against exhaustion of savings due to longevity.\n\n◦ Fixed Amount Option: This option provides the annuitant with a fixed payment until the contract\n\nvalue is exhausted, regardless of when that will be. If the annuitant dies before the contract is depleted, the beneficiary receives the remainder.\n\n◦ Cash Refund Payout Option: This option pays a guaranteed income to the annuitant for life. If the\n\nannuitant dies before all the money is exhausted, a lump-sum cash payment of the remaining funds is paid out to the annuitant’s beneficiary.\n\n◦ Installment Refund Payout Option: This option pays a guaranteed income to the annuitant for life.",

It designed so that benefit payments will continue for a minimum number of years regardless of when the annuitant dies. ‒ For example, if an annuitant selects a 20-year period certain and dies after 10 years, the\n\n◦ beneficiary will receive payments for another 10 years.\n\n◦ Joint and Full Survivor Payout Option: This option pays out the annuity to two or more people\n\nuntil the last annuitant dies. If one of them dies, the other will continue to receive the same income payments. There are two additional options made available with a joint and survivor payout: ‒ Joint and Two-Thirds Survivor: Survivor will have payments reduced to two-thirds of the\n\n◦ original payment.\n\n‒ Joint and One-Half Survivor: Survivor will have payments reduced to one-half of the original\n\n◦ payment.\n\nINVESTMENT CONFIGURATION\n\n◦ Annuities can also be defined by their investment configuration, which will determine the amount of\n\nincome the benefits pay. The two types of annuity classifications are fixed and variable. ‒ Fixed Annuities: Provide a guaranteed rate of return. Fixed annuities credit interest at a rate that’s no lower than the contract’s guaranteed rate. ‒ Variable Annuity: Doesn’t provide a guaranteed rate of return because of the investment risk. The cash value is based on the results of these investment funds. A statement must be provided to the owner of the annuity at a minimum of once per year. Copyright © . All rights reserved ‒ Variable annuities can be classified as either immediate or deferred. Insurers that deal with\n\n◦ variable annuities are subject to dual regulation by the SEC and the state’s Office of Insurance Regulation.\n\n◦ Accumulation Units: In a variable annuity, the value of the accumulation units varies depending on\n\nthe value of the securities investment that’s a part of a variable annuity.\n\n◦ Annuity Units: When the variable annuity is to be paid out to the annuitant, the accumulation units\n\nare converted into annuity units. These payouts can vary from month to month and will depend on the investment results. Although the number of units doesn’t change, the value of each unit will change. The amount of each variable annuity benefit paid to an annuitant varies according to the market value of the securities in the separate account.\n\n◦ Equity Indexed Annuities (EIAs): A type of fixed annuity that offers the potential for a higher return\n\nthan a standard fixed annuity. These EIAs may be tied to the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index or the Composite Stock Price Index.\n\n◦ Single-Life Annuities: Characterized by having only one annuitant.\n\n◦ Tax-Sheltered Annuities: Limited exclusively for employees of religious, charity, or educational\n\ngroups. These annuities are also referred to as 403(b) plans. ‒ Accumulation payments often come from voluntary salary reductions. ‒ The annuitant may have an individual account contract\n\n◦ Income Tax Treatment of Annuity Benefits: Annuity benefit payments consist of principal and",

The portion of annuity benefits that consists of principal (premiums paid into the annuity during the accumulation period) is not taxed and may be referred to as the owner’s “cost basis.” The portion of the annuity benefits that’s interest earned on the principal is taxable as ordinary income. Interest income must be reported for federal income tax purposes upon receiving distributions or income benefits from the contract.\n\n◦ Exclusion Ratio: This is a simple way to determine what portion of each annuity benefit payment is\n\ntaxable: Exclusion ratio = Investment in the contract ÷ Expected return.\n\n◦ Partial withdrawal: This is when funds are taken from an annuity before age 59 1/2. The withdrawal\n\nis considered 100% interest and is therefore taxable as ordinary income.\n\n◦ A 10% tax penalty is applied if a distribution is received before the annuitant reaches age 59 1/2.

The contributions may vary on a yearly basis, and contributions and interest are tax-deferred until withdrawal. • With pension plans, employers contribute to a plan based on the employee’s compensation and years of service; it’s not based on company profitability or performance.\n\n◦ Money purchase plans allow employers to contribute a fixed annual amount, apportioned to each\n\nparticipant, with benefits based on funds in the account upon retirement.\n\n◦ Target benefit plans have a target benefit amount.\n\n◦ Stock bonus plans are similar to a profit-sharing plan, except that the employer’s contributions are\n\nnot dependent on profits and benefits are distributed in the form of company stock.\n\n◦ 401(k) plans allow employers to make tax-deductible contributions to the participant, either by\n\nplacing a cash bonus into the employee’s account on a pre-tax basis or the individual taking a reduced salary with the reduction placed pre-tax in the account. The account’s funds are taxable at the time of withdrawal.\n\n◦ Tax-sheltered annuities are a particular class of retirement plans that are available to employees of\n\nspecific charitable, educational, or religious organizations.\n\n◦ Simplified employee pension (SEP) plans are basically an arrangement whereby an employee\n\n(including a self-employed individual) establishes and maintains an IRA to which the employer contributes. Employer contributions are not included in the employee’s gross income. A primary difference between a SEP and an IRA is that considerably more money can be contributed to an employee’s SEP plan.\n\n◦ A Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plan is available to small businesses\n\n(including tax-exempt and government entities) that employ no more than 100 employees who received at least $5,000 in compensation from the employer during the previous year. An employer can choose to make non-elective contributions of 2% of compensation on behalf of each eligible employee. To establish a SIMPLE plan, the employer must not have an existing qualified plan.\n\n◦ Keogh (HR-10) plans are for self-employed persons, such as doctors, farmers, lawyers, or other sole-\n\nproprietors. Keoghs may be defined contribution or defined benefit plans. Contributions are tax- deductible, and interest and dividends are tax-deferred. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ IRAs are established by individuals who have earned income and want to save for retirement.\n\n◦ Traditional IRAs allow for an individual to contribute a limited amount of money per year, and the\n\ninterest earned is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Contribution limits are indexed annually and are currently at $6,000 per year or 100%of earned income. Any person who’s 50 or older may contribute an additional $1,000, thereby making her maximum annual contribution $7,000. Some individuals may deduct IRA contributions from their taxes based on their adjusted gross income (AGI), but all withdrawals are taxable as ordinary income. If an individual or spouse is not covered by an employer- sponsored retirement plan, the entire contribution is tax-deductible (regardless of AGI). Withdrawals that are made prior to age 59 1/2 are assessed an additional 10% penalty tax.\n\n◦ To avoid penalties, traditional IRA owners must begin to receive payment from their accounts by no\n\nlater than April 1 following the year in which they turn the age of 72.\n\n◦ Funds may be withdrawn from an IRA prior to the employee reaching the age of 59 1/2 without being\n\nsubject to the 10% penalty tax (however, the interest is still taxable) for any of the following reasons: ‒ Death, disability, first-time homebuyers (up to $10,000 lifetime), education (no dollar\n\n◦ maximum), health insurance premiums (if unemployed), and qualified medical expenses\n\n◦ Roth IRAs are designed so that withdrawals are received income tax-free.

      "content": "Determining the Proper Insurance Amounts  Human Life Value Approach: Calculates the amount of money that a person is expected to earn over his lifetime to determine the face amount of life insurance he needs, thereby placing a dollar value on an individual’s life.  Needs Approach: A method of life insurance planning that identifies the needs of an individual and their dependents. This approach determines the total funds available to a family from all sources and subtracts the amount needed to meet their financial objectives. It takes into consideration: ‒ Final expense fund ‒ Housing fund ‒ Education fund ‒ Monthly income ‒ Emergency fund ‒ Income needs (if disabled or ill) ‒ Retirement income ‒ Estate conservation (using life insurance to enable heirs to pay estate taxes) ‒ “Needs” include ANY PERSON or ENTITY who’s dependent on that person (e.g., child,\n\n◦ charity, or pet)\n\n◦ The needs approach to personal life insurance planning may involve creating a lump-sum to provide\n\nfor such things as education, retirement, and charitable contributions.\n\n◦ The needs approach to personal life insurance planning also includes the creation of an emergency\n\nreserve fund that’s primarily designed to cover the cost of unexpected expenses.\n\nBusiness Uses of Life Insurance\n\n◦ Buy-Sell agreements—also referred to as business continuation agreements—are used to assure the\n\nbusiness’s ownership is appropriately transferred upon the death or disability of an owner or partner. Third-party ownership of life insurance policies is widely used in business insurance and estate- planning situations.\n\nBuy-Sell Funding for Sole Proprietors\n\n◦ There’s a two-step business continuation plan to keep a business running after the proprietor’s death,\n\nwhereby the employee takes over management of the business: 1. Buy-Sell Plan: An attorney drafts a buy-sell plan which indicates the employee’s agreement to\n\n◦ purchase the proprietor’s estate and sell the business at a price that has been agreed upon beforehand.\n\n2. Insurance Policy: The employee purchases a life insurance policy on the life of the proprietor.\n\n◦ The employee is the policyowner, beneficiary, and pays the premiums. Upon the proprietor’s death, the funds from the policy are used to purchase the business.\n\nCopyright © . All rights reserved\n\nBuy-Sell Funding for Partnerships\n\n◦ There are two types of buy-sell agreements for partnerships:\n\n1. Cross-purchase plans 2. Entity plans\n\n◦ In a cross-purchase plan, each partner buys, pays the premiums, and is the beneficiary of a life\n\ninsurance policy on each of the other partners. The amount of the policy is equivalent to each partner’s share of the business. When one partner dies, each of the other partners receives the death benefit from the life insurance on the deceased partner, which is then used to purchase the business ownership of the deceased partner.\n\n◦ In an entity plan, the partnership itself agrees to buy the deceased partner’s share of the business.\n\nEntity plans are best for businesses with several partners. In this case, the business purchases, pays the premiums, and is the beneficiary of life insurance on each partner.\n\nBUY-SELL FUNDING FOR CLOSELY HELD CORPORATIONS\n\n◦ Unlike a partnership, a closely held corporation (e.g., an incorporated family business) is legally\n\nseparate from its owners and exists after one or more owners dies. A closely held corporation may purchase either buy-sell plans (i.e., either cross-purchase or entity). The difference is that an entity plan is referred to as a stock redemption plan for closely held corporations.\n\n◦ Closely Held Corporation Cross-Purchase Plan\n\n‒ Similar to partnership cross-purchase plans, a closely held corporation cross-purchase plan",

The amount of life insurance is equal to each stockholder’s share of the corporation’s purchase price. When a stockholder dies, the corporation purchases, or redeems, the deceased stockholder’s share.\n\n◦ Key Person Insurance: The purpose of key person insurance is to prevent the financial loss that may\n\nresult when an owner, officer, or manager dies. ‒ It pays for finding and training a replacement if the key employee dies prematurely. ‒ The company purchases, owns, pays the premiums, and is the beneficiary of the key person’s life\n\n◦ insurance policy.\n\n‒ The premiums are not deductible for income tax purposes.

Illness (Sickness or Disease) • A sickness (or illness) is best thought of as an internal occurrence that becomes manifest. It may have a sudden onset or develop over time. Accidents • An accident is an unintended occurrence resulting in a loss caused by an external source; it’s fixed in time and space. Covered Losses There are five distinct types of losses covered within the broad field of health insurance—medical expense, disability, dental expense, accidental injury, and long-term care.  Hospital expenses  Surgical expenses  Physician expenses  Outpatient care\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n• Policyowners can control the premium cost of a disability income plan by electing a longer\n\nelimination period than may otherwise be desired. Since the benefits that are received from an individually funded disability policy are income-tax-free, policies limit benefits to a percentage of a person’s pre-disability gross earnings. Accident Insurance • Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) insurance—a prominent type of accident insurance— pays a lump-sum benefit amount when an accident results in the insured’s death or dismemberment.\n\nClasses of Health Insurance The “class” of insurance is another way to categorize the various kinds of health insurance policies, including:  Individual versus group contracts  Private versus government insurance  Limited risk versus comprehensive policies Individual versus Group Contracts\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nPrivate versus Government Insurance •     The federal government offers:\n\n◦ Medical insurance for seniors through Medicare, and\n\n◦ Disability insurance through Social Security (OASDI)\n\n• The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)—also simply referred to as the\n\nAffordable Care Act (ACA)—created state-based and state-administered health insurance exchanges. • TRI-CARE is the federal government health plan for active duty and retired service members, as well as their families, and survivors. It has three options: 1. TRI-Care Prime – which uses military treatment 2. TRI-Care Extra – which is a PPO 3. TRI-Care Standard – a fee-for-service option Comprehensive versus Limited\n\n◦ For example, major medical insurance covers most recognized medical treatments unless specifically excluded.\n\n◦ For example, an aviation policy provides benefits for accidental death or dismemberment if death or injury results from an aviation accident during a specified trip.\n\nLimited Insurance Policy Types Limited risk policies cover a specific risk. An example of a limited risk policy is accidental death and dismemberment contracts, which provide benefits only when covered losses occur as a result of accidental bodily injury. State insurance departments require insurance companies to include a ‘Notice to the Insured’ stating that the contract is a Limited Benefit Policy. A limited risk is different from a special risk. A special risk policy covers unusual hazards that are not normally covered under ordinary accident and health insurance.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nA limit risk policy covers a common risk in a limited manner. The policy may be “limited” in the perils\n\ncovered (accidents or a named disease), the time frame (a specific trip), or the nature of the loss (death or\n\nDISMEMBERMENT).\n\nACCIDENT-ONLY\n\n• Accidental death and dismemberment insurance pays a lump-sum benefit amount in the event of\n\naccidental death or dismemberment. In general, the insured must die within 90 days of the accident for the\n\nDEATH BENEFIT TO BE PAID.\n\nSPECIFIED (DREAD) DISEASE\n\n• Dread disease policies provide limited benefits for a specific disease, such as cancer or heart disease.\n\nCRITICAL ILLNESS (SPECIFIED CONDITIONS)\n\n• Critical illness contracts pay a lump sum to the insured upon the diagnosis and survival of a critical\n\nillness. Benefits can be used to cover non-medical expenses. Covered conditions typically include heart\n\nattacks, strokes, organ transplants, and end stage renal failure.\n\nHOSPITAL INDEMNITY (INCOME)\n\n• While the insured is confined to a hospital, hospital indemnity insurance policies pay a specified\n\namount on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis directly to the insured (not the hospital). Payment is based\n\nONLY ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS CONFINED IN A HOSPITAL.\n\nCREDIT DISABILITY\n\n• Credit disability insurance plans protect a lender against the disability of a borrower before the",

The circumstances are constant, but the group’s\n\ncomposition (individuals within the group) continually changes. As with other group contracts, the group\n\nis the policy owner; however, unlike other group policies, individual enrollment is not required, and\n\nCERTIFICATES OF COVERAGE ARE NOT ISSUED.\n\nCopyright © .

Most prescription drug policy plans have a co-payment requirement when a prescription is being filled. • Some private health care plans cover the costs of audiological tests, hearing aid evaluation, and partial or full coverage for hearing aids. • Vision care coverage typically pays the cost of eye examinations by ophthalmologists and optometrists. The cost of contact lenses or eyeglasses is often partially covered. • Short-term medical insurance policies typically last for as little as 90 days and may provide coverage for as long as 364 days (just less than one year). Short-term plans are a stripped-down version of medical expense coverage, and consumers have traditionally used these plans as interim coverage to bridge gaps between more robust forms of coverage. In return for a lower premium, insurance buyers must cope with many of the restrictions that are eliminated in major medical policies by the ACA. These policies may be medically underwritten and may exclude pre-existing conditions.\n\nDental Insurance Most dental plans require a review of suggested treatment to ensure it’s reasonable and necessary. This process is defined as a predetermination of benefits, pre-certification, or prior authorization of benefits. All dental plans include limitations, exclusions, and caps on annual benefits. Other common exclusions involve:  Cosmetic procedures unless they’re due to an accident  Services provided by governmental agencies  Treatment that’s covered by Workers’ Compensation  Duplicate dentures or the replacement of lost or stolen dentures  Oral hygiene instructions or similar training  Exotic procedures, such as splinting and restoring occlusion Replacement of prosthetic appliances (e.g., retainers) is excluded for five years after the benefits are paid Dental plans may also include limitations on benefits for dental emergency services that are offered outside the network area.\n\n◦ Copyright © .

Out-of-Network Coverage  Insureds who receive out-of-network care pay a higher share of the cost.  Subscribers pay a substantial co-insurance percentage.  POS plans don’t necessarily base payments on average market prices (usual and customary costs). Instead, they calculate their coverage based on their lower in-network costs. Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs)  An EPO is a hybrid of an HMO and a PPO.  Like a PPO, an insured doesn’t need a referral to obtain care from an in-network specialist.  Like an HMO, an insured is responsible for paying out-of-pocket for care from an out-of-network provider.\n\nGroup Insurance Plans  Group health insurance is a class of policy rather than a provider.  Group health insurance is a distinct source of coverage with shared characteristics. The entire class of policies is treated as a distinct provider. Basic Group Plan Characteristics  The nature of the sponsoring group must be acceptable.  State laws specify the minimum number of persons to be covered under a group policy.  Employers may differentiate the benefits offered according to the common characteristics that distinguish the employee classes (union versus non-union, full-time versus part-time, etc.).  Employers cannot discriminate against specific individuals within a particular employee class. Eligible Groups  To qualify for group health coverage, the group must be a natural group.  The term “natural group” means that it must have been formed for some reason other than to obtain insurance.  Taft-Hartley Trusts are formed as a result of collective bargaining between a labor union and an employer.  Employers are prohibited from paying funds directly to a labor union to provide group health insurance to its members.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nPolicy Ownership\n\n◦ Insurers issue the policy—referred to as the master contract—to the employer or the other\n\nsponsoring organization.\n\n◦ The sponsor is considered the master policy owner.\n\n◦ Covered individuals receive a certificate of insurance.\n\n◦ Participants also receive an outline or booklet that describes their benefits.\n\n◦ Typically, group benefits are more extensive than those provided by individual health insurance\n\npolicies.\n\n◦ Group health plans often offer broader coverage, including ancillary programs, higher benefit\n\nmaximums, and lower out-of-pocket costs.\n\nLOWER COST\n\n◦ The cost of insuring an individual under a group health plan is lower than an individual policy’s cost\n\nbecause of lower administrative and selling expenses.\n\nCONSOLIDATED ADMINISTRATION\n\n◦ Administrative costs are lower because the carrier insures multiple individuals under one contract.\n\n◦ Also, the policy owner (employer or another sponsor) helps provide services to the enrolled\n\nparticipants.\n\nPREDETERMINED BENEFITS\n\n◦ The sponsor predetermines benefits for individual insureds, which simplifies underwriting and\n\nadministrative costs.\n\nINCREASED PERSISTENCY\n\n◦ When a person drops an individual insurance policy, the contract is lost.\n\n◦ When an individual participant leaves a group, the master contract remains in force.\n\nUNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT",

All rights reserved\n\n◦ ‒ How eligibility is to be determined ‒ Whether the group plan is contributory or non-contributory ‒ The group’s industry or business and the employees’ occupations\n\nIndividual Eligibility\n\n◦ Commonly imposed eligibility requirements include:\n\n‒ Full-time workers only (30 or more hours per week) ‒ A probationary period of at least one to three months of services before a person is eligible for\n\n◦ coverage.\n\nEnrollment Period\n\n◦ Once an employee is eligible for coverage, there’s a limited enrollment period, during which time\n\nthe employee can elect coverage.\n\n◦ Enrollment periods are 31 days unless state law requires a longer period.\n\n◦ If an employee doesn’t elect insurance coverage during the enrollment period, an application for\n\ncoverage that’s submitted outside of enrollment periods will be evaluated on an individual basis, which would require evidence of insurability.\n\n◦ A change of life event (e.g., marriage or the birth of a child) allows individual participants a special\n\nenrollment period. Participation Requirements\n\n◦ Minimum participation requirements from among eligible classes of enrollees help insurers to avoid\n\nadverse selection.\n\n◦ If a group’s participation percentage drops, the insurer may terminate the plan.\n\nContributory Plans\n\n◦ If employees pay a portion of the group insurance premium, the plan is a contributory plan.\n\n◦ Contributory group health plans often require participation by 75% of eligible members.\n\nNon-Contributory Plans\n\n◦ If the employer pays the entire premium, the plan is a non-contributory plan.\n\n◦ Most non-contributory group health plans require 100% participation by eligible members.\n\nState Variations\n\n◦ Standard percentages for participation are benchmarks, not the product of law. Requirements may\n\nvary with each state.\n\nAlternative Forms of Group Insurance Multiple Employer Trusts (METs)  The Multiple Employer Trust (MET) is a method of marketing group benefits to employers that have few employees.  A MET combines multiple employers (10 or more) into a single pool for the purpose of providing group insurance.  A MET holds the master contract rather than the participating employers.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ An employer that wants to obtain coverage for employees from a Multiple Employer Trust must first\n\nbecome a member.\n\n◦ A MET typically funds benefits with an insurance contract that’s purchased from an insurance\n\ncompany.\n\n◦ A MET may be insured and administered by a third-party administrator (TPA).\n\n◦ These trusts are also referred to as 501(c)(9) trusts after the relevant section of the Internal Revenue\n\nCode.\n\n◦ Partially self-funded trusts limit potential losses by purchasing stop-loss insurance.\n\n◦ State regulations pertaining to METs vary.\n\nMULTIPLE EMPLOYER WELFARE ARRANGEMENTS (MEWA)\n\n◦ A Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement is similar to a MET; in fact, the terms are often used\n\ninterchangeably.\n\n◦ MEWAs are tax-exempt entities.\n\n◦ MEWAs consist of two or more employers that have joined to provide affordable health benefits for\n\ntheir employees on a self-funded (or self-insured) basis.\n\n◦ Employees who are covered by a MEWA are required by law to have an employment-related common\n\nbond.\n\n◦ MEWAs are risk retention instruments. The law treats them as “employee welfare benefit plans” and\n\nsubjects them to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) mandates, which often supersede state insurance department regulations.\n\nSELF-INSURANCE\n\n◦ “Self-insurance” does NOT mean “no insurance.”",

This is based on the Constitutional Doctrine of Interstate Comity.  Having a single state of jurisdiction means that the group insurance contract must only conform to that one state’s laws and regulations.  The producer will generally deliver a group health insurance policy to the location of the employer.  Federal regulatory requirements apply regardless of state lines. The Termination of a Group Plan  An employer or fiduciary must provide a 45-day notice of termination of the plan to all those covered.  If a group health plan terminates, employees may convert to an individual health plan without evidence of insurability. Impact of Termination on Covered Individuals  Unless the law states otherwise, coverage for an employee and his dependents can terminate on the date employment is terminated.  Termination may occur in other circumstances, including: ‒ An employee ceases to be eligible (regardless of the reason) ‒ The master policy is surrendered or canceled ‒ An employee fails to make a required contribution ‒ The end of a continuation of benefits period for employees and dependents that follows the\n\n◦ termination of a person’s employment\n\n◦ Coverage under group plans may be continued for employees and dependents even after employment\n\nends due to COBRA or other applicable laws or policy provisions.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nContinuation and Conversion\n\nExtension of Benefits  An extension of benefits covers open, existing claims when an employee or dependent is sick or disabled at the time the insured’s group membership ends.  This extension doesn’t cover new claims.  Disability benefits will continue until the disability ends.  Medical insurance offers coverage that continues to pay for active claims at the time of termination, including hospitalization or medical care, but generally not for more than 12 months.",

Remember, collecting two or more benefits is a prohibited act.\n\n◦ The purpose of a short-term disability (STD) policy is to quickly replace a percentage of the insured’s\n\nincome while she recovers from a temporary injury or illness that prevents her from working but is less serious in nature. ‒ Common uses included surgery and childbirth.\n\n◦ Long-term disability (LTD) plans provide longer benefit periods and are typically reserved for an injury\n\nor illness that’s more serious in nature.\n\nQUALIFYING FOR BENEFITS  Disability income policies primarily define “disability” as the inability to perform tasks or earn an income.  Disability income policies also include “medical definitions” of disability based on a direct physical injury rather than any consequential income loss.  Some contracts cover losses at work, while others do NOT. Copyright © . All rights reserved  Being under the care of a physician is required regardless of whether the contract defines disability based on a person’s: ‒ Loss of income, or ‒ Inability to perform the duties of his employment\n\nTotal Disability  Disability insurance policies define the term “disability” as either a loss of income, a loss of a person’s ability to work at a job, or both.\n\nInability to Perform Duties  Disability income policies generally define disability as a person’s “inability to perform the material and substantial duties” of one or more occupations.  The phrase “material duties” refers to the actual tasks or activities that a person performs while doing her job.  The term “substantial duties” can also be referred to as “key duties” or “essential capabilities.”\n\nAny Occupation  The “any occupation” definition of disability requires an insured to be unable to perform “the material and substantial duties” of: ‒ Her own occupation, or ‒ Any occupation for which she’s reasonably suited by education, training, or experience.\n\nOwn Occupation  The own occupation definition of disability requires the insured to be unable to perform “the material and substantial duties of her own occupation.”  This definition is less restrictive than the “any occupation” definition.  Such policies are more expensive and often reserved for certain professions.",

      "content": "Combination Definition  The “own occupation” definition of disability applies during the first two years of the claim.  If a claim continues beyond two years, the “any occupation” definition applies.  The loss of earnings test is used to determine whether an income loss has actually occurred.  Earned income doesn’t include passive income.\n\nPure Loss of Income (Income Replacement Contracts)  A person must generally lose at least 20% of his income to qualify for a disability benefit.  Policies that define disability purely as a loss of income are referred to as “income replacement contracts.”  Insurers first offered at-work benefits to encourage beneficiaries to return to work. Copyright © . All rights reserved  Partial disability is defined as a person’s inability to perform some of the key duties of his own occupation or the inability to work at his own job full-time.  This benefit encourages disabled insureds to return to work without fear of losing all their benefits.  The traditional partial disability benefit was 50% of the total disability benefit for a maximum of six months.\n\n[EXAM TIP: ASSUME THIS IS TRUE FOR THE LICENSING EXAM.]\n\n◦ Residual disability is a proportional disability benefit that’s based on loss of income. The amount of\n\nincome lost defines the degree of disability. The insured receives a percentage of the total disability benefit. For example: If Frances suffers a disability that results in a 40% loss of income, she will have a residual disability rating of 40%. Frances’s policy will pay her 40% of her policy’s total disability benefit.\n\n◦ The recurrent disability clause applies when the insured returns to work after a disability but suffers a\n\nrelapse.\n\n◦ Under the terms of the recurrent disability provision, the relapse is considered part of the original\n\ndisability if it occurs within six months after the insured returns to work. As such, the following conditions apply: ‒ No new elimination period (benefits begin immediately) ‒ No new benefit period (If the insured has a five-year benefit period and has already received six\n\n◦ months of benefits before returning to work, he now has 4.5 years remaining.)\n\n◦ Presumptive disability identifies certain conditions that automatically qualify an insured for the total\n\nbenefit.\n\n◦ Losses that qualify as presumptive disabilities include the following:\n\n‒ Double dismemberments ‒ Total and permanent loss of sight ‒ Total and permanent loss of hearing ‒ Total and permanent loss of speech\n\nConcurrent Disability  When disabling events occur in tandem and result in a single period of disability, the condition is referred to as a concurrent disability.\n\nDelayed Disability  In some cases, total disability doesn’t occur immediately after an accident. Copyright © . All rights reserved  Most policies cover total disability claims that manifest some time (e.g., 20, 30, 60, or 90 days) after the occurrence that caused them.  The amount of time allowed for a delay between the cause and resulting disability is referred to as delayed disability.\n\nConfining versus Non-Confining Disability\n\n◦ Confined disability requires the insured to remain indoors (at home or in the hospital).\n\n◦ Non-confined disability means that an insured is not required to remain indoors.\n\n◦ Some disability income policies don’t cover losses arising out of the occupation of the insured.\n\n◦ This type of disability income contract is referred to as non-occupational coverage.\n\n◦ If the policy pays a monthly income in addition to any benefits received by Workers’ Compensation or\n\nother social insurance plans, it provides occupational coverage.\n\n◦ Credit disability guarantees the payment of loan installments if the insured debtor becomes disabled.\n\n◦ Credit disability contracts may also be referred to as “decreasing term disability policies.”\n\n◦ The policy pays the creditor, not the debtor.\n\n◦ Once the debt is paid off, the policy terminates.\n\n◦ There are two types of disability benefits found in life insurance:\n\n‒ The waiver of premium rider, which waives the cost of coverage while the insured is disabled. ‒ The disability income rider converts 1% of the policy’s face amount into a disability benefit.\n\nGOVERNMENT (SOCIAL) DISABILITY INSURANCE\n\n◦ Social Security provides disability benefits that are funded by payroll taxes.",

For example, if an applicant’s gross earned income is $3,000 per month, an insurer will allow him to buy a policy with a monthly benefit of up to $1,800. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ Percent-of-Earnings Approach This approach defines the benefit as a fixed percentage of the\n\ninsured’s pre-disability earnings.\n\n◦ This approach is primarily used in group insurance.\n\n◦ If the insured’s income increases, the benefit also increases to maintain the percentage.\n\n◦ Flat Amount Approach Individual disability policies use the flat amount method, which defines\n\nbenefits as a specific dollar amount.\n\n◦ It remains fixed despite changes in income unless the insured has purchased riders allowing him to\n\nincrease his coverage.\n\n◦ When calculating a disability claim, we must account for the elimination period.",

Morbidity is considered the likelihood of a person becoming disabled. • Individuals in certain professions (e.g., physicians and attorneys) engage in less hazardous work. Also, their income potential is much higher than their potential benefits. • Other white-collar and gray-collar occupations are considered riskier, especially since the incentive to return to work is not as great. • Many blue-collar occupations have a higher incidence of physical injury and the highest morbidity rates. In such cases, the insurer will restrict policy terms and limit the benefit period’s length to either two or five years.\n\n◦ This provision allows the insurance carrier to automatically change the premium or benefit if the insured\n\nhas not informed the insurer of a change in risk.\n\n◦ If the insured’s new occupation is riskier, the benefit decreases.\n\n◦ If the insured’s new occupation is less risky, the premium decreases.\n\nCopyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ The relation of earnings to insurance limits the total amount of benefits paid to the amount of pre-\n\ndisability income, even if the available insurance from multiple policies is greater than the income lost.\n\n◦ If the available insurance that covers a loss is greater than the loss itself, each policy’s benefit is reduced\n\non a pro-rata basis.\n\n◦ This type of rider is also referred to as an exclusion rider or waiver for impairments.\n\n◦ Insurers use this rider to permanently exclude certain losses if the risk is too high or too uncertain.\n\n◦ It allows insurers to cover most risks for an applicant while still charging a standard premium.\n\n◦ The rehabilitation benefit encourages individuals to actively participate in their recovery.\n\n◦ The rehabilitation benefit facilitates vocational training to prepare insureds for a new occupation.\n\n◦ The rehabilitation benefit provision requires the insurer to pay the approved cost of a rehabilitation\n\nprogram as long as the insured remains disabled and active in the program.\n\n◦ The non-disabling injury benefit pays up to a specified amount if the insured suffers an injury and no\n\nother claim is filed.\n\n◦ Disability insurance policies are either non-cancelable and guaranteed renewable or guaranteed\n\nrenewable.\n\n◦ Neither type of policy can be canceled or non-renewed by an insurer unless the insured fails to pay his\n\npremium.\n\n◦ If a policy is non-cancelable, the insurer guarantees the premium rate for the contract’s life as it existed\n\nwhen the insurer issued the policy.\n\n◦ If the policy is guaranteed renewable, the insurance carrier has the right to raise rates if the cost of\n\ndisability claims exceeds expectations.\n\n◦ The law prohibits an insurance company from raising policy premiums on a particular individual.\n\n◦ A company may raise rates on an entire class of policies. This is referred to as raising rates on a “class”\n\nbasis because it’s based on the entire pool of affected contracts.\n\n◦ Guaranteed renewable policies are more common, especially for classes of employment with higher\n\nlevels of morbidity risk.\n\n◦ Disability income policies typically require the insured to be actively working for a stated number of\n\nhours per week if coverage extends past the age of 65.\n\n◦ The more common exclusions in a disability income policy include:\n\n‒ War (declared or undeclared) ‒ Intentionally self-inflicted injuries Copyright © .

      "content": "GROUP DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE PLANS  The group must be a natural group.  Insurers base premiums on the group’s aggregate.  Employers may sponsor multiple plans and restrict participation per plan according to the class of the employees.  Insurance carriers require a minimum level of participation to avoid adverse selection.  Group policies often don’t have probationary period provisions. Instead, most group disability plans require new participants to fulfill a minimum required length of service before becoming eligible for coverage.  Group insurance policies have an elimination period.  For example, let’s assume that an employer allows employees two weeks of sick leave per year, a six- month short-term disability plan, and long-term disability insurance. The benefit design may include the following: ‒ A five-day or 10-day elimination period for the short-term disability benefit, and ‒ A 180-day elimination period for the long-term disability benefits  Ideally, the package design allows participants to move seamlessly between the different disability benefits.  The benefit periods for group insurance mirror those for individual insurance policies.  Group insurance policies define disability benefits as a percentage of an insured’s wages.  The benefit amount changes as the employee’s compensation changes. Copyright © . All rights reserved  Group disability plans coordinate benefits with other groups and social insurance programs, such as Social Security.  Group plans are secondary to Workers’ Compensation for work-related claims.  Some group disability plans limit coverage to non-occupational disabilities. [EXAM TIP: In a real-world group, disability insurance can be “occupational” or “non- occupational” insurance. For purposes of the licensing exam, we suggest for students to consider it to be “non-occupational.”]  Group insurance plans often provide both total disability and partial disability benefits.  As with individual plans, group disability can include short-term plans or long-term plans.  The labels “short-term” disability and “long-term” disability are used a little differently in group plans.  Group short-term disability plans have short maximum benefit periods of 13 weeks (where allowed by law) or 26 weeks.  Benefits are typically paid weekly and range from 50% to 100% of the individual’s income.  The definition of disability is the insured’s own occupation.  Group long-term disability plans provide maximum benefit periods of two years or more, often extending to the insured’s retirement age.  Benefit amounts are generally limited to between 50% and 70% of the participant’s income.  In some cases, the employer will pay for a benefit that’s equal to 50% of their employees’ wages and allow employees to enhance their coverage level up to 20% at their own expense.  Long-term plans often use an “own occupation” definition of total disability for the first two years of disability and then switch to an “any occupation” definition.\n\nBUSINESS USES FOR DISABILITY INSURANCE  Insurers use disability insurance to facilitate business continuation in the event of a disabling sickness or injury.  Policies used for business continuation are individually underwritten.  While group insurance is designed for the average worker, these policies benefit owners, key employees, and the organization.  Business overhead expense (BOE) insurance covers business expenses and payroll costs if the owner becomes disabled.  BOE policies don’t insure the disabled owner’s income.  BOE contracts cover the costs of the day-to-day business operations to help the enterprise continue functioning.  Insurers sell BOE to professionals in private practice, self-employed business owners, partners, and close corporations in which a business owner: ‒ Directly generates a significant portion of company income, or ‒ Directly oversees day-to-day operations Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ Rather than a fixed indemnity, business overhead expense policies pay a maximum monthly amount for\n\ncovered expenses such as: ‒ Rent or mortgage payments ‒ Utilities ‒ Telephone and internet service ‒ Leased equipment ‒ Employee wages ‒ The cost to hire a temporary replacement\n\n◦ Disability buy-out policies fund disability buy-sell agreements much the same way life insurance\n\npolicies do.\n\n◦ The buy-out plan sets forth the terms for transferring the ownership share of a business; the insurance\n\nprovides the funds.\n\n◦ In the cross-purchase plan, each partner buys a policy that covers each of the other owners.

All rights reserved\n\n◦ Unlike typical disability income insurance contracts, disability buy-out policies contain a provision that\n\nallows the insurer to pay a lump-sum benefit.\n\n◦ Disability buy-sell policies also have lengthy elimination periods, often as long as two years.\n\n◦ Key-person disability insurance indemnifies the business for a key person’s lost services.\n\n◦ This type of coverage pays a monthly benefit or lump sum if an essential person is disabled.\n\n◦ A key person could be a partner, stockholder, or key employee.\n\n◦ The key person’s economic value to the business is the potential loss of business income plus the\n\nexpense of hiring and training a replacement.\n\n◦ Generally, the policy’s elimination period will be from 30 to 90 days, and the benefit period will be from\n\none or two years.\n\n◦ The business is the owner and premium payor of the policy.\n\nTAXATION OF DISABILITY INSURANCE POLICIES  When it comes to disability insurance, the IRS generally taxes the money only once—either when the premiums are paid in or when the benefits are taken out.  The taxation of social insurance disability benefits depends on the program and the income of the recipient.  Social Security Insurance benefits are partially taxed after one’s total income reaches $25,000 for individuals and $32,000 for married couples filing jointly.  In general, workers’ compensation benefits are not subject to state or federal income tax.  Premiums are not deductible. The IRS counts premiums as part of taxable income and captures a percentage as income tax.  Benefits are not taxable. Because the IRS collects income tax on money going into the policy, the insured receives benefits from the policy, free of income tax.  The premiums paid by employers are tax-deductible as legitimate business expenses.  The group policy benefits the employees, not the employer or the business.  The taxation of employee premium dollars and benefits depends on several sets of circumstances (described below). Copyright © . All rights reserved  If the employer pays a participating worker’s disability insurance premium, the benefits are taxable.\n\n◦ The employer deducts the premium from taxable income; therefore, the IRS will tax the money coming\n\nout of the policy in the form of benefits.\n\n◦ If an employee pays group premiums on a pre-tax basis through a cafeteria plan, the IRS will tax any\n\nbenefits as income.\n\n◦ The pre-tax contribution avoids taxation when money is paid to the insurer; therefore, the IRS will tax\n\nfunds when benefits are paid, often when they’re needed the most.\n\n◦ In some companies, employees pay their disability premiums with after-tax dollars.\n\n◦ In such cases, the premiums are not deductible (i.e., they’re after-tax), so the benefits are not taxable.\n\n◦ If the employee-paid portion of the premium is paid pre-tax, then the entire benefit is taxable.\n\n◦ If employees pay their portion of the premium with after-tax dollars, the benefit will be partially taxable\n\nand partially tax-free. The degree to which the benefit is income tax-free reflects the percentage of the premium that’s taxable.\n\n◦ The IRS will only tax the funds once—either on the way in or on the way out.\n\n◦ For a business overhead expense policy, the premium is a tax-deductible business expense.\n\n◦ The benefit is considered a part of taxable revenue.\n\n◦ The benefits offset other deductible business expenses.\n\n[EXAM TIP: When trying to figure out what a BOE policy does NOT cover, the answer is\n\n“employer income” or “the insured’s lost income” or some other similar answer.]\n\n◦ The company buys disability insurance on each partner or each shareholder in a closed corporation.\n\n◦ If the partner or the shareholder is disabled, the company receives the benefit.\n\n◦ The taxation works like a standard individual policy. Since the policy holder (the company) pays a\n\npremium with after-tax dollars, the policy benefit is income tax-free.",

Prohibited Practices  Duplication of coverage – This is the illegal sale of multiple Medigap policies to one person. The producer must attempt to determine whether other coverage exists.  High-pressure tactics – This refers to any sales approach that uses explicit or implicit threats, excessive pressure, or creates a climate of fear.  Cold lead advertising – This is an advertising or marketing practice that fails to disclose that an agent may call to solicit the sale of a Medicare supplement.  Twisting – This is the illegal use of misrepresentation or deception to induce an individual to replace an existing policy with another contract. Producer Compensation  First-year commissions cannot exceed 200% of the second-year commissions paid for the same sale.  Furthermore, the commission amount paid in year two of the contract must continue for five years. Medicare Select  Medicare Select is a type of Medicare Supplement that’s available in most states and works like a closed-end HMO.  Medicare Select plans mirror the benefits in standard Medigap policies, but the individual agrees to use certain, insurer-designated providers in return for a lower premium.",

All rights reserved\n\nThe Levels of Long-Term Care\n\n◦ The three long-term care levels are skilled nursing care, intermediate nursing care, and custodial\n\ncare.\n\n◦ Skilled Nursing Care\n\n‒ Skilled nursing care consists of daily nursing and rehabilitative care. ‒ Care may be performed by (or under the supervision of) skilled medical personnel and based on\n\n◦ an attending physician’s orders.\n\n‒ Skilled nursing care involves 24-hour care.\n\n◦ Intermediate Nursing Care\n\n‒ Intermediate nursing care is intermittent or occasional nursing and rehabilitative care. ‒ It’s based on a physician’s orders and provided by skilled medical personnel.\n\n◦ Custodial Care\n\n‒ Custodial care is non-medical care. ‒ It involves assistance with personal needs such as bathing, walking, eating, dressing, or taking\n\n◦ medication (the ADLs).\n\n‒ Medically unskilled persons can provide this care; however, it must still be approved and ordered\n\n◦ by a physician.\n\nThe Delivery of Long-Term Care Services  Formal care is paid care. ‒ Individuals receive formal care from paid caregivers, whether in a nursing home, assisted living\n\n◦ facility, or at their own home.\n\n◦ Informal is unpaid care.\n\n‒ Caregivers in one’s family, such as a spouse or offspring, traditionally provide informal care.\n\n◦ Insurance policies only pay for formal care; however, policies may provide informal caregivers with a\n\ntraining allowance.\n\n◦ Nursing Homes\n\n‒ Nursing homes are primarily designed to provide skilled nursing care for persons with medical\n\n◦ issues and a significant loss of functions.\n\n‒ Nursing home residents often need end-of-life care related to significant chronic conditions or\n\n◦ recovery from an acute illness.\n\n◦ Assisted Living Facilities\n\n‒ An assisted living facility is a residential community that provides more limited services than a\n\n◦ nursing home.\n\n‒ Assisted living facilities offer intermittent nursing services such as help with managing\n\n◦ medications.\n\n‒ They also provide personal services such as housekeeping, onsite meal facilities, and social\n\n◦ activities.\n\n◦ Home Health Care\n\n‒ Home health care is care provided in the insured’s home. ‒ It primarily includes skilled care, such as care delivered by visiting nurses, including assistance\n\n◦ with medication, wound care, and the monitoring of chronic conditions.\n\n‒ Home health care also includes rehabilitative or physical therapy ordered by a doctor.\n\n◦ Home Care\n\n‒ Home care is personal care. ‒ Home health aides help clients perform the activities of daily living and activities such as\n\n◦ transportation, meal preparation, and housework.\n\nCopyright © . All rights reserved ‒ Such care may include hands-on help and stand-by assistance, both of which fall in the\n\n◦ category of substantial assistance.\n\n◦ Adult Daycare\n\n‒ Adult daycare is designed for seniors who live at home but whose family members cannot stay\n\n◦ at home with them during the day.\n\n‒ Since the primary caregiver is absent or at work, families must make other provisions for the\n\n◦ senior adult’s care.\n\n‒ The level of care provided at adult daycare centers is similar to home health care.\n\n◦ Continuing Care Communities\n\n‒ Continuing care communities allow elderly individuals to access progressively more intensive\n\n◦ levels of care without leaving the community that has become their home.",

Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nLong-Term Care Riders in Life Insurance Contracts\n\n◦ A person may add LTCI to life insurance as a living benefits rider.\n\nAccelerated Death Benefit Riders  An accelerated death benefit rider pays out a portion of the life insurance policy’s death benefit upon the diagnosis of a terminal illness or other condition.  Some riders pay a monthly benefit if the insured is confined to a nursing home with the expectation that the insured’s condition will not improve.  Insurers subtract any amounts paid as living benefits from the death proceeds paid to the beneficiary.  The NAIC does NOT include these riders in its model definition of long-term care insurance.\n\nLong-Term Care Riders  Long-term care riders use part of a life insurance policy’s face amount to pay a monthly benefit to pay the cost of long-term care services.  Insureds qualify for benefits on the same basis as those covered by stand-alone long-term care insurance policies.",

      "content": "LTC Hybrid (Linked) Plans  Hybrid long-term care plans combine annuity (or life insurance) benefits with a traditional long- term care policy.  The insureds have long-term care benefits guaranteed, or if no care is needed, the other guaranteed contract benefits for themselves or their beneficiaries.  Hybrid products are written using whole life insurance or annuities.  Unlike simple life insurance riders, the potential long-term care benefit is greater than the underlying contract and must be underwritten.\n\nLong-Term Care (Stand-Alone) Insurance Policy  The accident and health insurance licensing exam focuses on the individual long-term care insurance policy.\n\nQualifying for Long-Term Care  LTCI contracts have two distinct benefit triggers: ‒ The loss of the physical ability to perform two or more of the six ADLs, or ‒ The existence of cognitive impairment.\n\nLoss of the Ability to Perform Two ADLs  The six recognized ADLS are as follows: ‒ Bathing ‒ Dressing ‒ Toileting ‒ Transferring ‒ Continence ‒ Eating  Policies will pay benefits when the insured cannot perform two or more of these tasks without substantial assistance, which the NAIC defines as either: ‒ “Hands-on” (physical) assistance, or ‒ “Stand-by assistance”\n\nCognitive Impairment  The NAIC Model LTCI regulation defines a “cognitive impairment” as a deficiency in a person’s: ‒ Short or long-term memory ‒ Orientation as to person, place, and time Copyright © . All rights reserved ‒ Deductive or abstract reasoning, or ‒ Judgment as it relates to safety awareness  LTCI specifically covers conditions related to organic neurological disorders related to diseases of aging, strokes, and brain injuries.\n\nLong-Term Care Insurance – Benefit Periods  The LTCI benefit period is the length of time during which claims will be paid.  Policies often require a diagnosis that a person’s impairment is expected to last 90 days or more.  LTCI policies define benefits as a maximum daily amount that’s payable during the benefit period as stated in the contract.\n\n“Pool of Money” Concept  The “pool of money” concept indicates that the policy’s total benefits are limited by the number of available dollars, not a limited number of days. For example, let’s assume that an LTCI contract with a three-year benefit period pays a maximum of $100 per day for institutional care and $50 per day for home care. ‒ The maximum daily benefit (for institutional care) is $100 per day. ‒ 1,095 days x $100 per day = a $109,500 pool of money. ‒ This calculation means that the policy will pay the maximum daily benefit for three years. If the\n\n◦ insured only uses the policy to pay for home care, the policy will pay only $50 per day for six years ($109,500 = $50 x 2,190 days).\n\nDaily Benefit Amounts  LTCI includes a daily limit to benefits.  A higher daily limit means a higher annual premium.  Policies often set home care limits between 50% and 80% of the maximum benefit for nursing home care.  LTCI contracts pay daily benefits in one of two ways—as a fixed daily indemnity or based on the actual costs incurred (reimbursement). For example, let’s assume that an insured has a long-term care insurance policy with a stated daily benefit of $200 per day. The insured incurs covered costs of $150 during a single 24-hour period. ‒ If the insured has a policy that pays a daily indemnity, the insured will receive $200. ‒ If the insured has a policy that reimburses actual costs up to $200, the insured will receive $150.\n\nElimination Period  LTCI policies generally include an elimination period.  This period helps to restrain the cost of coverage for prospective policyholders.\n\nWaiver of Premium  The waiver of premium provision suspends premium payments while the insured is receiving benefits.  Some LTC policies offer a lower premium by not including this feature and offering it as an optional rider instead. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nLong-Term Care Insurance – Optional Provisions\n\nReturn of Premium Option  The return of premium rider refunds the premiums paid by the policy owner under certain circumstances, such as when a policy lapses or the insured dies without using the policy’s benefits.",

Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nQualified Long-Term Care Policies\n\n◦ To be designated as tax-qualified, a long-term care insurance policy must meet the following criteria:\n\n‒ The policy cannot pay expenses that are reimbursable under Medicare. ‒ The benefit trigger must be either the loss of a person’s ability to perform two of the six ADLs or\n\n◦ the existence of a severe cognitive impairment.\n\n‒ The policy is at least guaranteed renewable. ‒ The policy doesn’t include a cash surrender value. ‒ The policy only provides long-term care services. ‒ The policy has a 30-day fee-look period. ‒ The policy requires all claims to be based on a medical diagnosis of disability lasting at least 90\n\n◦ days.\n\n‒ When an insured files a claim, the policy requires that a medical professional devise a written\n\n◦ plan of care.\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, and LTCI  Medicare, Medicaid, and long-term care insurance address senior citizens’ needs, but the role of each policy is distinct and not interchangeable. The following section offers a quick comparison of these three mechanisms.\n\nMedicare  Medicare is medical insurance in the traditional sense for individuals who are the age of 65 and older, along with certain individuals who suffer from a severe disability. It provides treatment to acute and chronic illnesses to cure acute conditions or treat chronic diseases so as to mitigate them.\n\nMedicaid  Medicaid is a means-tested, public program that was established to provide medical and supportive services to individuals who are at or below the poverty line. The funding comes from both the federal government and state budgets. Each state administers its own program.  Medicaid services overlap with both Medicare and long-term insurance. Low-income individuals who are the age of 65 and older can qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid to cover their medical costs more fully. Senior citizens who lack assets can be eligible for long-term services and supports (LTSS) paid by Medicaid.  Originally, Medicaid paid for LTSS delivered in nursing homes. However, given the increasing costs of such care, the federal government granted states the authority to devise alternative programs that deliver such services using alternative avenues, such as in-home care. Individuals can qualify for Medicaid funding for LTSS only when their countable assets (other than their residence and some other such property) are depleted. At times, more affluent individuals may attempt to qualify for Medicaid while sheltering assets from liquidation by transferring property to relatives. The states consider all asset transfers over the five years before any application for Medicaid benefits. If an insured transfers assets to family members, the medical assistance administrators will delay the insured’s access to public funding for long-term services and support.",

In accordance with the NAIC Model, there are 23 uniform provisions for use in insurance contracts—12 uniform mandatory provisions and 11 uniform optional provisions.  Insurance companies may substitute their own language with approval from their various state regulators.  Substitute language can be no less favorable to the insured. This uniform language requirement helps assure a consistent understanding of policy terms and provisions.\n\nTHE 12 REQUIRED (MANDATORY) UNIFORM\n\nPROVISIONS\n\nThe Entire Contract Clause\n\n◦ In a health insurance policy, the entire contract clause defines the entire contract as the policy, the\n\ninsured’s application, and any papers that are attached to the policy document.\n\n◦ Nothing outside of the contract (as described above) can be considered part of the contract.\n\n◦ It assures the policy owner that no changes will be made without the policy holder’s written consent.\n\n[EXAM TIP: Remember WYSIWYG. “What you see is what you get!”]\n\nTime Limit on Certain Defenses (Incontestability)\n\n◦ The time limit on certain defenses provision declares the policy to be incontestable after it has been\n\nin force for three years.\n\n◦ Fraud on a health insurance application is always grounds for termination unless the policy is\n\nguaranteed renewable or non-cancellable.\n\n◦ A number of states reduced the time limit on certain defenses to two years.\n\n[EXAM TIP: Assume a time limit of three years unless the test references state law or integrates law and general questions. In other cases, check the law, and assume three years if no specific reference is given.]\n\nGrace Period\n\n◦ Insurers must include a grace period following the premium due date, during which time the insured\n\nmay make the delayed premium payment without penalty or loss of coverage. The specified minimum grace periods are: ‒ Seven days for policies with weekly premium payments (i.e., industrial policies) ‒ 10 days for policies with premiums payable monthly, and ‒ 31 days for other policies\n\nReinstatement\n\n◦ The reinstatement provision restricts reinstatement payments to premiums that are due within the\n\nprevious 60 days.\n\n◦ Reinstatement is automatic if the insurer accepts the delinquent premium and doesn’t require an\n\napplication.

All rights reserved\n\n◦ If the insurer requires an application, the insurer must respond to the application within 45 days, or the\n\npolicy is automatically reinstated.\n\n◦ Reinstated policies cover accidents immediately and impose a 10-day probationary period on losses\n\ndue to sickness.\n\nNotice of Claim  The notice of claim provision describes the policy owner’s obligation to notify the insurer of loss within a reasonable period—20 days after the occurrence or as soon as reasonably possible after that.  For long-term disability claims, an insurer may request notice of claim every six months to ensure a continuing disability.\n\n[EXAM TIP: Assume 20 days unless the exam specifies a disability claim.]\n\nClaim Forms  The company must supply a claim form within 15 days after receiving notice of claim or accept information in any format that the insured provides.\n\nProof of Loss  An insured claimant must provide proof of loss with 90 days of the occurrence.  If the insured is legally incapable of doing so, she can provide proof within one year.\n\nTime of Payment of Claims  The time of payment of claims provision provides for: ‒ Immediate claim payment after notification and proof of loss ‒ At least monthly payments for disability income claims\n\n[EXAM TIP: If an exam references the required frequency of disability payments, it may describe\n\nthe minimum requirements as “no less frequently than monthly.” An accurate reading is\n\nESSENTIAL.]\n\nPayment of Claims  The payment of claims provision states that health insurance benefits must be payable to the insured.\n\nPhysical Exam and Autopsy  The physical exam and autopsy provision gives the insurer the right to require a physical examination or autopsy of an insured, at its own expense, before paying a claim.  This physical exam or autopsy is allowed unless it’s forbidden by state law.",

      "content": "INSURING CLAUSE  The insuring clause is the part of the health insurance policy that primarily states: ‒ The benefits provided and ‒ The circumstances under which they’re payable  The clause defines the insurance company’s promise to pay benefits.\n\nCONSIDERATION CLAUSE  The consideration clause defines the insured’s consideration.  The policy owner’s consideration consists of the following two elements: ‒ The premium paid, and ‒ The statements (legal representations) that are made on the health insurance application\n\nWAIVER OF PREMIUM  The waiver of premium provision waives the payment of premiums after the insured has been totally disabled for the specified period (as stipulated in the policy).\n\nMILITARY SUSPENSE PROVISION  This provision temporarily suspends coverage for an insured who’s called up to activity duty, but coverage resumes when the period of service ends. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nRENEWABILITY PROVISIONS\n\n◦ Health insurance policies have one of the various renewability clauses that define the circumstances\n\nunder which an insurer may change or terminate an existing contract.\n\n◦ The insured can cancel the policy at any time.\n\nNON-CANCELLABLE POLICIES  A non-cancellable policy is one that cannot be canceled as long as the policy owner pays the premium.  Some contracts refer to this type of policy as “non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable.”  The insurer can neither modify the policy’s terms nor increase the premium.  This type of renewal provision is the most advantageous renewal provision for a policy holder but is also the most expensive.\n\nGUARANTEED RENEWABLE POLICIES  Insurers cannot terminate a guaranteed renewable policy as long as the premium is paid.  The insurer cannot change policy benefits, conditions, or terms in any way.  The insurer is allowed to increase premiums on a class basis (not on a specific policy) in response to a general change in the class’s aggregate risk level. For example, a disability income insurer can raise premiums on all policies that are issued to nurses and other gray collar professionals in response to an increase in back injuries and the rise of new infectious diseases. It cannot increase the premiums paid by a specific nurse because of chronic back problems.\n\nCONDITIONALLY RENEWABLE POLICIES  An insurer may decide not to renew a conditionally renewable policy under certain conditions that are stated in the policy.  These conditions are typically related to the insured reaching a certain age or losing gainful employment.  The stated reasons that allow an insurer to terminate coverage are based on general conditions, not individual insurability.  Carriers can also increase policy premiums at renewal on a class basis only.\n\nOPTIONALLY RENEWABLE POLICIES (RENEWABLE\n\nAT COMPANY’S OPTION)  The optionally renewal policy offers no guarantee of continuance beyond the end of the current policy renewal period.  The insurer also has the option to increase the premiums for any policy class (not an individual policy).\n\nNON-RENEWABLE POLICIES  Non-renewable policies are typically used to meet short-term health insurance needs.  These policies remain in force for one year or less.  Policy holders use them to bridge anticipated coverage gaps.

      "content": "CANCELLABLE POLICIES  Either the insured or insurer may cancel coverage.  The renewability provision allows the insurer to cancel this type of policy with a five-day written notice and the return of any unearned premiums.  An insurer may cancel an individual policy if the insured files too many claims in a policy period.  Most states don’t allow the issuance of cancellable health insurance policies.\n\nPOLICY EXCLUSIONS, LIMITS, AND RESTRICTIONS  Health insurance policies frequently cite a number of exclusions or conditions that are not covered, such as: ‒ Injuries due to war or an act of war ‒ Injuries sustained while serving in the armed services ‒ Self-inflicted injuries, including suicide ‒ Injuries while the insured is piloting an aircraft or serving as a crew member ‒ Non-commercial air travel ‒ Foreign travel, especially extended stays overseas or foreign residence ‒ Losses resulting from riots, or the use of drugs or narcotics ‒ Injuries sustained while attempting or committing a felony ‒ Losses covered by Workers’ Compensation ‒ Care paid by the Veterans Administration (VA) ‒ Cosmetic surgery, experimental surgery, and vision correction\n\nPROBATIONARY PERIOD  The probationary period is a one-time 30-day event that becomes effective when the policy is issued.  It excludes losses due to illness during the first days of a new policy, asserting the infection occurred before coverage began, even if symptoms did not appear until after coverage began.  Coverage for accidents is not excluded.\n\nPRE-EXISTING CONDITION PROVISIONS  The preexisting condition provision states that a health insurance policy will not cover any health condition that existed during the period immediately before the policy became effective. Most often, this provision applies to conditions that are not disclosed in an insurance application.  This provision is essential for group insurance or other contracts with simplified underwriting or none at all.  This provision helps to protect an insurer regardless of whether an applicant knows he’s ill.  This provision doesn’t typically apply to disclosed preexisting conditions. (See “impairment rider” below.) Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nIMPAIRMENT (WAIVER FOR IMPAIRMENT) RIDER\n\n◦ An impairment rider is also referred to as an exclusion rider, coverage waiver, or a waiver of\n\ndisability.\n\n◦ Impairment riders allow an insurer to restrict coverage for an illness or injury that’s disclosed on an\n\napplication for the life of the contract.\n\n◦ Since the rider allows the insurer to exclude a significant source of greater than average risk, the\n\ninsurance carrier can often provide coverage at the standard premium.\n\n◦ If an impairment rider is attached to a policy, its restrictions or limitations must be explained to the\n\npolicy owner at the time of delivery. Generally, the policy owner must sign a statement that he’s aware of and understands the effects and limitations of this type of rider.\n\nADDITIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY\n\nPROVISIONS\n\nOWNER’S RIGHTS PROVISION  This provision states that the policy holder is entitled to all of the ownership rights under the health insurance contract.\n\nASSIGNMENT PROVISION  Unlike life insurance, policy owners don’t have an unlimited ability to transfer their rights because health insurance is a personal contract.  They can assign certain benefits to providers for direct payment of expenses.\n\nBENEFICIARY PROVISION  When health insurance includes a death benefit, the Required Uniform Mandatory Provisions include a “change of beneficiary” provision.  This provision may require detailed information that’s most commonly associated with life insurance.\n\nBeneficiary Types\n\n◦ Insurance gives the insured the ability to deliver benefits directly to named individuals, groups, or\n\ninstitutions without going through the probate process.\n\n◦ If no beneficiary is named, any death benefit is included in the insured’s estate.\n\n‒ Individual beneficiaries: In this case, the insured names one or more specific individuals to\n\n◦ receive a death benefit.\n\n‒ Beneficiary Class: A beneficiary class or class designation defines beneficiaries by describing\n\n◦ them rather than naming them.\n\nOrder of Succession\n\n◦ Primary beneficiaries: These beneficiaries receive all of the benefits at the insured’s death.\n\n◦ Secondary (contingent) beneficiaries: These beneficiaries only receive benefits if all of the primary\n\nbeneficiaries have predeceased the insured.

All rights reserved\n\nMODES OF PREMIUM PAYMENT PROVISION\n\n◦ The provision governing the premium mode allows the policy holder to select the frequency of their\n\npolicy premiums, such as: ‒ Monthly ‒ Quarterly ‒ Semiannually, or ‒ Annually\n\n◦ The annual mode is the least expensive mode of premium, while the monthly premium is the most\n\ncostly.\n\n◦ A “single-premium” is not an option for health insurance policies.\n\nREDUCTIONS IN COVERAGE  The reductions in coverage provision states that health insurance policies don’t reduce coverage amounts following a loss.\n\nBENEFIT PAYMENT PROVISION  The benefit payment provision states how benefits will be paid.  The benefit payment provision will differ depending on the policy involved.\n\nNO LOSS / NO GAIN PROVISION  This provision states that the purpose of insurance is primarily to “indemnify” a person for a loss.\n\nRESTORATION OF BENEFITS PROVISION  The restoration of benefits provision states that the amount paid out for a loss doesn’t reduce the total available benefits for future claims. Some policies include this provision automatically, while others offer it as an optional rider. Some policies condition the restoration with a requirement to be claim-free for a specific period following a covered loss.\n\nCOORDINATION OF BENEFITS  The coordination of benefits provision is found in group insurance, but it also applies to social insurance programs (e.g., Medicare).  The provision limits the total amount of payments from all insurers that cover the claim to no more than the total cost of care (e.g., avoids duplication of benefits).  The COB provision also establishes which plan is primary and must pay all of the benefits specified by the contract. Once the primary insurance plan pays benefits as if it were the only available coverage, the secondary provider is liable for the remaining costs.  Employer-sponsored group insurance is the primary coverage for workers who are the age of 65 or older if the employer is a “COBRA group” of 20 or more employees.  If a group has fewer than 20 employees, Medicare is the primary insurer.  Medicare is always the primary coverage for any person with an individual policy or group retiree medical insurance.

      "content": "THE PURPOSE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF\n\nUNDERWRITING INSURANCE  The underwriting process determines an insurer’s ability to insure a loss exposure by reviewing and evaluating an applicant’s information and applying the carrier’s guidelines for insurability.  Once underwriters determine whether a loss exposure is insurable, they determine the required premium rate.\n\nRisk Factors in Health Insurance\n\n◦ The risk factors for life and health insurance are similar, but health insurers deal with a broader range\n\nof risks.\n\nInsurable Interest\n\n◦ Insurable interest is a prerequisite for issuing a health policy.\n\n◦ It exists if the applicant will suffer a loss in the event the insured incurs medical expenses or becomes\n\ndisabled.\n\nPhysical Condition and Health History\n\n◦ An applicant’s physical condition, which refers to his health and body build, is of primary importance\n\nwhen evaluating health risks.\n\n◦ Typically, an insurer is just as concerned with an applicant’s health history as it is with his current\n\nhealth. An applicant’s medical history can help predict future healthcare needs, as can his family’s health history.\n\nMoral Hazards\n\n◦ Applicants’ habits or lifestyles also indicate the potential of additional risks for the insurer. These\n\nfactors are referred to as moral hazards. Examples include excessive drinking or drug use. Other signs of moral hazard can be a low credit rating or dishonest business practices.\n\nOccupation and Hobbies\n\n◦ There’s a direct correlation between a person’s job and the probability and severity of a disabling\n\ninjury occurring.\n\n◦ If an applicant has two jobs, the insurance company will base the benefits and the premiums on the\n\nmore hazardous one.\n\n◦ An applicant’s hobbies and personal activities can also affect whether a carrier covers a proposed\n\ninsured. Activities such as mountain climbing or having a license to pilot small planes can affect insurability or, at best, increase the cost of coverage.\n\n◦ Hobbies are also referred to as avocations.\n\nAge and Sex\n\n◦ An insured’s age and sex (gender) are underwriting factors.\n\n‒ Generally, older applicants are more significant risks. ‒ Women have higher rates of disability at younger ages, but insurers CANNOT reject prospective\n\n◦ insureds based on gender. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nClassification of Risk Exposures (Applicants)\n\n◦ Once underwriters review an applicant’s information, they will determine that applicant’s level of risk\n\nor risk classification.\n\n◦ There are three classifications of those that are insurable. Individuals who are not insurable are\n\nclassified as declined.\n\nPreferred Risk\n\n◦ A preferred risk exceeds an insurer’s risk requirements.\n\n◦ Companies issue preferred risk policies with reduced premiums with the expectation of better (lower)\n\nthan average morbidity experience.\n\nStandard Risk\n\n◦ Individuals who are assigned a standard risk classification meet the same conditions as the tabular\n\nrisks on which the insurer’s premium rates are based.\n\n◦ A standard risk is an average risk.\n\nSubstandard (Rated) Risk\n\n◦ A substandard risk is an individual who fails to meet the insurer’s standard or average risk guidelines.\n\n◦ Insuring the substandard application involves taking on a greater-than-average risk of loss.\n\n◦ The terms “rated policy” and “rated premium” refer to a substandard policy with a higher-than-\n\naverage (rated-up) premium.\n\nPREMIUM CALCULATIONS\n\nGeneral Insurance Premium Concepts\n\nPremium\n\n◦ Premium is the initial payment and subsequent periodic payments required to keep a policy in force.\n\nPremium Mode\n\n◦ The mode refers to the frequency of premium payments.\n\n◦ Premiums can be paid quarterly, semiannually, or monthly.\n\n◦ The higher the frequency of payments, the more the policy will cost the insured in total.\n\nEarned Premium\n\n◦ Earned premium is a pro-rated amount of a paid premium that an insurer has “earned” by providing\n\ncoverage.\n\nUnearned Premium\n\n◦ Unearned premium represents the portion of paid premiums that has yet to be “earned” because it’s\n\nallocated to cover the remaining portion of the policy term.\n\nPolicy Term\n\n◦ This is the period during which a policy remains in existence when a premium is paid.\n\nPolicy Fee\n\n◦ The policy fee is a small transaction fee that’s charged by some insurers for the first or subsequent\n\nyears of an insurance policy, in addition to the regular premium.\n\n◦ Copyright © .

Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nThe Application\n\n◦ The principal source of underwriting information is the application.\n\n◦ It’s the agent’s responsibility to ensure that an applicant’s answers are both thorough and accurately\n\nrecorded.\n\n◦ There are three essential parts to a typical health insurance application:\n\n‒ Part I: General Applicant Information ‒ Part II: Medical and Health History, and ‒ Part III: The Agent’s Report or Statement\n\nPart I – General Applicant Information  Part I of the application asks general questions about the proposed insured.  Part I also describes details about the requested coverage, including policy type, benefit amount, beneficiary name(s), existing insurance, and any other needed information.  It also inquires as to whether the proposed insured uses tobacco.\n\nPart II – Medical and Health History  Part II asks about the proposed insured’s health and health history, as well as the health history of the proposed insured’s family.  The insurer may require a medical exam.  The prospective insured may be required to provide a blood test or urine specimen.  Any exams and lab work are done at the insurer’s expense.\n\nPart III – The Agent's Report (or Statement)  Part III is referred to as the agent’s report or agent’s statement.  The agent’s report includes personal observations about the proposed insured.  The agent can provide additional information about the applicant’s financial condition and character.  If a new policy replaces an existing one, states require agents to follow specific procedures to protect consumer rights.\n\nCompleting the Application  If an agent fails to ensure that an application is completed fully and accurately, several consequences may follow: ‒ Several delays will follow ‒ The applicant may also decide to do business elsewhere ‒ The insurance company will return the application to the agent if it’s incomplete.  Applicant answers to application questions are considered representations.  Representations are statements that are made with the belief that they’re substantially true to the best of the applicant’s knowledge.  Misrepresentations are considered fraudulent only when they’re material to the risk and made with fraudulent intent.\n\nApplication Signatures  All insurers require the producer to sign the application. If not, it will not be underwritten.  Each application also requires the signatures of the proposed adult insured and the policy owner (if different from the insured).  Where required by state law, the agent also must sign a form attesting that a disclosure statement has been given to the applicant. Copyright © . All rights reserved  Additionally, a form that authorizes the insurance company to obtain investigative consumer reports or medical information from investigative agencies, physicians, hospitals, or other sources generally must be signed by the proposed insured with the agent as a witness.",

      "content": "The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) of 1970  The FCRA protects the rights of consumers for whom a credit report is requested.  The FCRA established procedures for collecting and disseminating consumer credit information.  Let’s assume that an insurer declines a consumer due to poor credit. In this case, the FCRA requires the insurer to notify the applicant that a copy of the credit report is available through the appropriate credit bureau.\n\nInformation and Privacy Protection Act  According to the Information and Privacy Protection Act, insurers must conform to state and federal laws regarding the dissemination of a consumer’s private information.\n\nThe Initial Premium and Premium Receipts  The nature of a receipt is that it denotes the payment of funds for goods or services. In this case, it denotes the good faith payment of an initial premium in return for the company’s promise to pay. Premium receipts are important because they can establish a person’s protection under the terms of a policy before the insurer issues the contract.\n\nPremiums Paid with the Application  The proposed insured benefits from paying the initial premium with the application. Insurance protection becomes effective immediately; however, it comes with significant limitations.  If the first premium is not paid with the application, the policy will not become effective until the initial premium is collected.  An application without a premium is referred to as a trial application.  When an agent collects a premium with an application, the agent must give the applicant a premium receipt.  The type of receipt determines when coverage is effective. Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\nPremium Receipts\n\n◦ Applicants who pay a premium with the application are entitled to a premium receipt.\n\n◦ Two types of receipts exist—conditional receipts and binding receipts.\n\n◦ The date on a receipt is always earlier than the policy’s issue date.\n\n◦ Today, the most common type of premium receipt is a conditional receipt.\n\nConditional Receipts  Conditional receipts generally provide coverage as of the date of the receipt as long as a specific condition is satisfied.  Coverage is provided if the proposed insured demonstrates insurability.  Insurability may be accomplished simply by submitting the application and supporting documentation, or it may require a medical exam.  Coverage is effective on the condition that the applicant proves to be insurable, either on the date on which the application was signed or the date of the medical exam.  If the applicant proves to be uninsurable, no coverage takes effect, and the premium is refunded.\n\nInsurability Type Conditional Receipt  Coverage is effective if the proposed insured is found to be insurable as applied for (i.e., standard or better).  Coverage is effective as of the application date or the date of any required medical exam, whichever is later.  Policy delivery is not necessary for coverage to be in effect. [EXAM TIP: If the test refers to a conditional receipt with no further qualification, assume it’s an “insurability type conditional receipt.”]\n\nApproval Type Conditional Receipt  Approval type conditional receipts provide coverage only after the insurer has approved the application.  Approval type conditional receipts only provide coverage between the issue date and the delivery date.",

      "content": "Binding Receipts  Binding receipts are often referred to as temporary insurance agreements.  Binding receipt guarantees coverage unless the insurer formally rejects the application.  Even if uninsurable, the applicant is covered until the application is rejected.  A binding receipt typically stipulates the maximum amount that’s payable under the terms of the receipt.  Binding receipts are far more common for auto or homeowner’s insurance than life or health insurance.\n\nTemporary Insurance Agreement  A “temporary insurance agreement” is similar to a binding receipt.  In some jurisdictions, they’re used interchangeably.  In contrast to a binding receipt, this agreement can offer a level of additional protection.\n\nOffer and Counter-Offer  If an applicant completes an application and pays the first full premium, the applicant has made a legal offer.  If the insurer issues a policy as requested, it has accepted the applicant’s offer and a contract is in force. Copyright © . All rights reserved If the insurer declines the application, it has rejected the offer.  If the insurance company is willing to issue a “rated” policy at a higher than requested premium, the carrier has rejected the applicant’s initial offer but is making a counter-offer.  The applicant can accept the counter-offer by paying the additional premium and providing a statement of continued good health.\n\nPOLICY ISSUE AND DELIVERY  Once issued, the policy is sent to the agent for delivery to the applicant.  In most states, an agent is required to deliver an outline of coverage to the applicant.  In some cases (e.g., when selling long-term care insurance), agents must also deliver a Shopper’s Guide or Buyer’s Guide (generally before the agent accepts the applicant’s initial premium).  The outline of coverage describes (in simplified language) the key elements of the specific policy being delivered.\n\nPolicy Effective Date\n\n◦ Determining a policy’s effective date is important because it identifies when the coverage begins and\n\nestablishes the due date for future annual premiums.\n\n◦ If a premium receipt were issued, the receipt’s date would generally become the policy’s effective date.\n\n◦ If the applicant doesn’t pay an initial premium with the application, the insurance company will\n\ndetermine the policy’s effective date, which will generally be the issue date. (Coverage will not truly be in force until it’s delivered, the first premium is paid, and a Statement of Good Health is obtained.)\n\nConstructive Delivery\n\n◦ Constructive delivery means that an insurance carrier can legally deliver a policy without physically\n\ndelivering the contract into the policy owner’s possession.\n\n◦ Constructive delivery occurs if the insurer intentionally relinquishes all control over the policy and\n\nturns it over to a person who’s acting for the policy owner, including the company’s own agent.\n\n◦ Mailing the policy to the agent for unconditional delivery to the policy owner also constitutes\n\nconstructive delivery.\n\n◦ If the company requires a delivery receipt or statement of continued good health, there’s no\n\nconstructive delivery.\n\n◦ Possession of a policy by the client doesn’t establish delivery if all conditions have not been met.\n\nInspection Receipt\n\n◦ Some proposed insureds may want to review a policy before purchasing it.\n\n◦ In this situation, the policy owner will sign an inspection receipt rather than a statement of continued\n\ngood health and will not pay a premium.\n\n◦ The prospective insured will examine the policy and then pay the first full premium.\n\n◦ The free-look period makes this receipt obsolete.\n\nExplaining the Policy and Ratings to Clients\n\n◦ Most applicants will not remember all of the essential elements of their policies; therefore, agents\n\nshould deliver them in person.\n\n◦ By personally explaining the policy, the agent can avert misunderstandings, policy returns, and\n\npotential lapses.\n\n◦ Copyright © . All rights reserved\n\n◦ When the policy is a “rated” or substandard contract, the agent can discuss the reasons for it being so,\n\nincluding the insured’s increased need for protection.",

      "content": "Obtaining a Statement of Insured's Good Health  If the initial premium is not paid until delivery, the agent must collect the premium and obtain from the insured a signed statement attesting to the insured’s continued good health.  Because there can be no contract until the premium is paid, the company has a right to know that the policy holder has remained in reasonably good health from the time the policy holder signed the application until receiving the policy.\n\nDelivery (Policy) Receipt  When a producer delivers a policy to an insured, the insurance company often wants a delivery receipt as proof of delivery.  The delivery receipt is important because it designates the start of the policy’s free-look period.
