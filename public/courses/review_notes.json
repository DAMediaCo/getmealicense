      "content": "HEALTH INSURANCE\n\nTHE ROLE OF INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 In general terms, insurance can be defined as a legal contract that transfers an uncertain risk from one party to another.\n\n\u2022 Insurance can also be described as the transfer of risk through the pooling or accumulation of funds because it distributes one person\u2019s risk among a large number of people.\n\n\u2022 The insured transfers the possibility of suffering a large financial loss to an insurer in return for paying a relatively small, contractually defined premium.\n\n\u2022 Insurance helps to reduce the financial uncertainty of the policy owner that could otherwise result from future losses.\n\n\u2022 Insurance has become an essential element of any financial planning process.\n\nBENEFITS AND COSTS OF INSURANCE TO SOCIETY\n\n\u2022 Insurance policies indemnify policyholders.\n\n\u2022 To indemnify means to restore a person to the financial position they experienced prior to the insured loss.\n\n\u2022 The ability of insurance to eliminate the potential cost of unexpected or untimely losses is arguably its most significant advantage.\n\nTYPES OF INSURANCE COMPANIES\n\n\u2022 There are many ways to classify insurance carriers, including:\n\n\u25e6 Where the company was formed\n\n\u25e6 How ownership is structured\n\n\u25e6 Whether the company is authorized to conduct business in a given state, or\n\n\u25e6 Whether the insurer is a commercial carrier or government provider\n\nPRIVATE VERSUS GOVERNMENT INSURERS\n\n\u2022 Private citizens own commercial insurers, which may be proprietary or cooperative.\n\n\u2022 Federal and state governments also offer a variety of coverages, commonly referred to as social insurance.\n\n\u2022 Federal and state-owned government insurers either:\n\n\u25e6 Cover catastrophic perils or losses that are not insurable by commercial insurers, or\n\n\u25e6 Cover insurable risks in competition with, or instead of, commercial insurers.\n\n\u2022 Examples of social insurance programs include:\n\n\u25e6 Social Security\n\n\u25e6 Original Medicare\n\n\u25e6 Medicaid\n\n\u25e6 SGLI and VGLI\n\n\u25e6 National Flood Insurance Program\n\n\u25e6 Federal Crop Insurance Corporation\n\n\u2022 Private (Commercial) Insurance Companies\n\n\u2022 Companies that sell more than one line of insurance are referred to as multi-line insurers.\n\n\u2022 A company that only sells one line of insurance is a monoline insurer.\n\n\u2022 Stock and mutual companies are both be considered commercial insurers, and, as such, both can write\n\nlife, health, property, and casualty insurance.\n\n\u2022 Regulators require companies to maintain a certain percentage of surplus revenue as reserves to pay\n\nfuture claims. These funds are referred to as statutory reserves.\n\nSTOCK COMPANIES \u2013 NON-PARTICIPATING\n\n\u2022 A stock insurance company is one that\u2019s owned by private investors (stockholders or shareholders).\n\n\u2022 Stock insurers are incorporated under state laws, are structured like any other corporation, and their\n\ngoal is to make profits for their shareholders.\n\n\u2022 Typically, they\u2019re publicly traded.\n\n\u2022 A portion of the company\u2019s profits may be distributed to shareholders as dividends.\n\n\u2022 Stock insurers issue non-participating insurance policies.\n\n\u2022 Non-participating policies don\u2019t pay policy dividends.\n\n\u2022 Purchasing a non-participating policy does NOT give policy owners any other privileges of\n\nownership.\n\n\u2022 Post-tax earnings (earned surplus) that are retained by a company are considered equity and are\n\nowned by the shareholders.\n\nMUTUAL COMPANIES \u2013 PARTICIPATING\n\n\u2022 Mutual insurance companies are also organized under state laws but are owned by the\n\npolicyholders.\n\n\u2022 Policyholders have the right to vote for the board of directors.\n\n\u2022 Mutual insurance companies are considered participating insurers because policy owners receive a\n\nshare of surplus revenue in the form of policy dividends.\n\n\u2022 Mutual insurers hold such excess earnings as a divisible surplus.\n\n\u2022 Mutual insurers return this surplus to their policy owners by paying policy dividends.\n\n\u2022 Policy dividends represent a refund of that portion of the premium remaining after a company has set\n\naside the necessary reserves.\n\n\u2022 In some cases, a stock company may be converted into a mutual company through a process that\u2019s\n\nreferred to as mutualization.\n\nASSESSMENT MUTUAL INSURERS\n\n\u2022 Assessment mutual companies are classified by the method in which they charge premiums.\n\n\u2022 Pure assessment mutual companies charge no premium in advance; instead, each member is assessed\n\na portion of the losses that occur.\n\n\u2022 Advance premium assessment companies charge premiums but levy assessments if the premium is\n\ninsufficient.\n\nFRATERNAL BENEFIT SOCIETIES",

      "content": "\u2022 Fraternal societies are not-for-profit organizations noted for their social, charitable, and benevolent\n\nactivities.\n\n\u2022 Fraternal membership is based on religion, nationality, or ethnicity.\n\n\u2022 Fraternal societies also issue insurance covering their members.\n\n\u2022 To be characterized as a fraternal benefit society, the organization must have the following\n\ncharacteristics:\n\n\u25e6 It must be non-profit.\n\n\u25e6 It must have a lodge system, including ritualistic work and a representative form of government.\n\n\u25e6 It must exist for reasons other than obtaining insurance.\n\nRECIPROCAL INSURERS\n\n\u2022 A reciprocal insurer is an unincorporated organization in which individual members (also referred to\n\nas subscribers) agree to insure one another.\n\n\u2022 Unlike mutual or stock insurers, reciprocal policyholders don\u2019t transfer these risks to a separate\n\ncorporate entity. Each policyholder individually assumes a share of the risk.\n\n\u2022 This arrangement makes the reciprocal insurer a risk-sharing mechanism rather than a form of risk\n\ntransfer.\n\n\u2022 Policyholders receive policy dividends as well as their share of the company surplus (capital) if they\n\nterminate their membership.\n\n\u2022 An attorney-in-fact handles transactions for the reciprocal insurer.\n\nRISK RETENTION GROUPS (RRGS)\n\n\u2022 A risk retention group is a specialized insurance company that\u2019s created to provide liability\n\ninsurance for individuals and entities with a common bond.\n\n\u2022 The federal law requires risk retention groups to follow the laws of their home state.\n\n\u2022 Risk retention groups are only licensed in their state of domicile. In other jurisdictions, federal law\n\nprevails.\n\n\u2022 Risk retention groups hold on to risks and process claims\n\nRISK PURCHASING GROUPS (RPGS)\n\n\u2022 As with a risk retention group, a risk purchasing group provides insurance for individuals and entities\n\nwith a common bond.\n\n\u2022 RPGs differ from RRGs because they purchase coverage for their members from an insurance\n\ncompany rather than act as the insurer.\n\n\u2022 The risk purchasing group becomes a master policyholder, and its members receive certificates of\n\ninsurance.\n\nREINSURERS AND RETENTION LIMITS\n\n\u2022 Reinsurers insure other insurance companies that seek to limit the loss they would face if a substantial\n\nclaim became payable.\n\n\u2022 The insurance company that transfers its loss exposure (risk) to another insurer is referred to as the\n\nprimary insurer or ceding company.\n\n\u2022 The portion of the risk that a ceding insurer retains is considered the net retention.\n\n\u2022 The insurance company that accepts the risk is the reinsurer (also referred to as the assuming\n\ncompany).\n\n\u2022 There are two types of reinsurance contracts:\n\n\u25e6 When two companies arrange for an automatic sharing risk based on specific criteria, it\u2019s\n\n\u2022 considered treaty reinsurance.\n\n\u25e6 When a primary insurer seeks reinsurance for a specific exposure without an ongoing agreement,\n\n\u2022 it\u2019s considered facultative reinsurance.\n\nCAPTIVE INSURERS\n\n\u2022 A captive insurer is established and owned by a parent firm(s) to cover the parent\u2019s loss exposure.\n\nSURPLUS LINES INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 Surplus lines carriers provide types of coverage that are not available through authorized carriers.\n\n\u2022 Consumers place the coverage through a surplus lines broker for high, substandard, or unusual risks\n\nthat are rejected for coverage in the authorized market. Lloyd\u2019s of London\n\n\u2022 Lloyd\u2019s of London is a syndicate of individuals that individually underwrite insurance but is NOT an\n\ninsurer.\n\n\u2022 Lloyd\u2019s function is to provide coverages that may otherwise be unavailable.\n\nSelf-Insurers\n\n\u2022 A self-insurer establishes a self-funded plan to cover potential losses.\n\n\u2022 A self-insurer will often seek an insurance company that will provide insurance above a specified\n\nmaximum loss level.",

      "content": "INSURER CLASSIFICATIONS INSURERS CLASSIFIED BY AUTHORIZATION\n\n\u2022 An insurer with a certificate of authority that allows it to do business in a particular state is referred to as an authorized or admitted insurer.\n\n\u2022 Generally, an unauthorized (non-admitted) insurance company is not permitted to conduct insurance operations unless it qualifies as a surplus lines carrier.\n\nINSURER CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO DOMICILE\n\n\u2022 A domestic insurer is organized and incorporated in the state in which it writes business.\n\n\u25e6 For example, if XYZ Insurance Company is incorporated in Wisconsin and writes policies in\n\n\u2022 Wisconsin, it\u2019s a domestic company in that state.\n\n\u2022 A foreign insurer is authorized in one state but organized and incorporated under a different state\u2019s\n\nlaws.\n\n\u25e6 For example, if XYZ Insurance Company is incorporated in Wisconsin but transacts insurance in\n\n\u2022 Iowa, it acts as a foreign insurance company in Iowa.\n\n\u2022 An alien insurer is an insurer that\u2019s organized under the laws of a different nation.\n\n\u25e6 For example, Sun Financial Services of Toronto, Canada, is an alien insurer.\n\nDepartments within an\n\nINSURANCE COMPANY\n\n\u2022 The marketing or sales division is responsible for increasing the number of prospective applicants.\n\n\u2022 The sales department completes applications and conducts face-to-face appointments with prospective buyers.\n\n\u2022 The underwriting department reviews applications, conducts investigations, determines whether to issue coverage, and assigns risk classifications.\n\n\u2022 The claims department investigates, processes, and pays claims.\n\n\u2022 The actuarial department calculates policy rates, reserves, and dividends.\n\nKEY PEOPLE WITHIN AN INSURANCE COMPANY PRODUCERS\n\n\u2022 The term \u201cProducer\u201d refers to individuals who are licensed by the state regulatory authority to solicit, sell, or transact the placement of insurance products with the buying public.\n\n\u2022 Licensed producers act in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of both their insurers and their clients.\n\n\u2022 The various types of producers include:\n\n\u25e6 Agents represent one or more insurers under the terms of an appointment contract.\n\n\u25e6 Brokers represent themselves and the insureds.\n\n\u25e6 Solicitors are licensed in some states to represent a producer and solicit prospective applicants to\n\n\u2022 meet and discuss their insurance needs with that producer.\n\n\u25e6 Service Representatives work in some states under a limited authority.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 They\u2019re insurance company employees in some states that hold a limited license.\n\n\u2022 They don\u2019t earn commissions for sales.\n\n\u2022 They\u2019re not required to be licensed unless they solicit, countersign policies, or collect premiums from policy owners.\n\nUnderwriters\n\n\u2022 Underwriters identify, assess, examine, and classify the amount of risk represented by an applicant.\n\n\u2022 Underwriters approve or decline applications and determine the cost of insurance.\n\nActuaries\n\n\u2022 Actuaries calculate policy rates, reserves, and dividends.\n\nAdjusters\n\n\u2022 Adjusters investigate insurance claims to determine whether they should be settled or denied.\n\n\u2022 A public adjuster is compensated for acting on behalf of an insured regarding the settlement of an\n\ninsurance claim.\n\n\u2022 How Insurance is Sold\n\n\u2022 Most consumers purchase insurance through licensed producers who market insurance products and\n\nservices to the public.\n\n\u2022 Typically, these producers are agents who are appointed to represent one or more insurance\n\ncompanies.\n\n\u2022 Agents can bind insurance; in other words, they can commit the insurer to cover a risk exposure\u2014at\n\nleast temporarily.\n\n\u2022 Some consumers may work with brokers who work for insureds to place coverage. Brokers are not\n\nappointed by the insurer and don\u2019t have the authority to bind coverage.\n\n\u2022 In a sales transaction, agents represent the insurer, while brokers represent the buyer.\n\nCAREER AGENCY SYSTEM\n\n\u2022 A career agency is often a branch of a major stock or mutual insurance company.\n\n\u2022 A career agency may exist to represent an insurer in a specific geographical area or market.\n\n\u2022 A general agent (GA) typically runs a career agency.\n\n\u2022 The GA recruits, trains, and supervises career insurance agents.\n\n\u2022 The GA has a vested right in any business that\u2019s written by those agents who sell for the agency.\n\nMANAGERIAL SYSTEM\n\n\u2022 The managerial system is a form of career agency.\n\n\u2022 The insurance company hires a salaried branch manager to run the agency.",

PERSONAL PRODUCING GENERAL AGENCY SYSTEM\n\n\u2022 The personal producing general agency (PPGA) system resembles the career agency system, but\n\nPPGAs don\u2019t recruit, train, or supervise career agents.\n\n\u2022 A personal producing general agent focuses on selling insurance in an assigned market or geographic\n\narea.\n\n\u2022 PPGAs are generally responsible for maintaining their own offices and administrative staff.\n\n\u2022 Agents who are hired by a PPGA are considered employees of the PPGA, not the insurer.\n\nINDEPENDENT AGENCY SYSTEM\n\n\u2022 The independent agency system is not tied to any particular insurance company.\n\n\u2022 Independent agents represent any number of insurance companies through contractual agreements.\n\nOTHER METHODS OF SELLING INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 A large volume of business is also marketed through direct selling and mass marketing methods.\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies that use the direct selling method deal directly with consumers.\n\n\u2022 Direct sellers use vending machines, advertisements, or salaried sales representatives who are\n\nlicensed.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u25e6 Insurance is also sold through mass marketing techniques, such as over the Internet, newspapers,\n\nmagazines, radio, and television ads.\n\n\u2022 Mass marketing methods provide exposure to many consumers, often using direct selling methods\n\nwith occasional follow-up by agents.\n\nEVOLUTION OF INDUSTRY OVERSIGHT\n\n\u2022 The insurance industry is regulated by a number of authorities, including some within the industry itself.\n\n\u2022 The primary purpose of this regulation is to promote public welfare. Federal Court Cases and\n\nLEGISLATION AFFECTING INSURANCE INDUSTRY REGULATION\n\n\u2022 In the 1868 case of Paul v. Virginia, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the sale and issuance of insurance is not interstate commerce, thereby upholding a state\u2019s right to regulate insurance.\n\n\u2022 In the 1944 case, the United States v. Southeastern Underwriters Association (SEUA), the United States Supreme Court revisited the issue of state versus federal regulation.\n\n\u25e6 The Supreme Court reversed Paul v. Virginia and ruled that the insurance industry is a form of\n\n\u2022 interstate commerce.\n\n\u25e6 The Court determined that the federal government should regulate insurance.\n\n\u2022 In 1945, Congress passed Public Law 15\u2014the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The McCarran-Ferguson\n\nAct created the following:\n\n\u25e6 It called for the states to continue their regulation of the insurance industry because it was in the\n\n\u2022 public\u2019s best interest.\n\n\u25e6 It also made possible the application of federal antitrust laws so far as state laws did not regulate\n\n\u2022 such activity.\n\n\u25e6 Today, the insurance industry is both state-regulated and in conformity with federal antitrust\n\n\u2022 requirements.\n\n\u25e6 Any person who violates the McCarran-Ferguson act faces a fine of $10,000 or up to one year in\n\n\u2022 prison.\n\n\u2022 In 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act was enacted to protect privacy by requiring the fair and\n\naccurate reporting of consumer information and for insurers to inform applicants about any investigations being made\n\n\u25e6 If insurers deny coverage or charge higher rates due to a consumer report, the applicant must\n\n\u2022 receive the name of the relevant reporting agency.\n\n\u25e6 Insurers that fail to comply are liable for actual and punitive damages.\n\n\u25e6 The maximum penalty for obtaining consumer reports under false pretenses is a $5,000 fine and\n\n\u2022 up to one year in prison.\n\n\u2022 In 1994, Congress amended Sections 1033 and 1034 of the United States Code (USC) regarding\n\nFraud and False Statements.\n\n\u25e6 It\u2019s a criminal offense for felons who are convicted of crimes involving dishonesty or a breach of\n\n\u2022 trust to participate in the insurance business without a \u201cLetter of Written Consent\u201d from their state insurance regulators.\n\n\u25e6 The law makes it illegal to lie, falsify, or conceal information from a federal official.\n\n\u25e6 Any person that engages in intentionally unfair or deceptive insurance practices is violating\n\n\u2022 federal law.\n\n\u25e6 Other violations include embezzling money, misappropriating insurance premiums, and writing\n\n\u2022 threatening letters to insurance offices.\n\n\u25e6 The punishment for violation is a fine of up to $50,000, up to 15 years in prison, and license\n\n\u2022 revocation.\n\n\u2022 In 1999, the Financial Services Modernization Act removed the barriers that kept commercial",

The law aims to detect, deter, and disrupt terrorist efforts and funding while prosecuting international money laundering.\n\n\u2022 In 2003, the Do Not Call Implementation Act implemented the Do Not Call Registry.\n\n\u25e6 The Act allows consumers to list their phones so that telemarketers (including insurers) cannot\n\n\u2022 legally make solicitation calls.\n\n\u25e6 Calls made on behalf of charities, political organizations, and surveys are exempt.\n\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC)\n\n\u2022 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is an industry association that consists\n\nof all state insurance regulators.\n\n\u2022 The NAIC brings together regulators and industry personnel on committees that study various aspects\n\nof insurance practices, laws, and regulations.\n\n\u2022 The organization has four broad objectives:\n\n1. To encourage regulatory uniformity among the states 2. To promote efficiency in the administration of laws and regulations 3. To protect policy owners and consumer interests, and 4. To preserve state regulation of the insurance business\n\n\u2022 The NAIC recognizes that state laws regarding insurance marketing, trade practices, and regulations\n\nmay vary, but share more similarities than differences. Model Acts and Model Regulations developed by the NAIC provide a template for individual state legislators and regulators.\n\n\u2022 The NAIC is not a regulatory organization. Instead, the models it creates provide a common\n\nframework for state officials that allow the various governing bodies to meet the specific needs of their respective jurisdictions while helping to streamline the legislative and administrative processes and helping to standardize the outcomes.\n\nUNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES ACT (MODEL)\n\n\u2022 Most jurisdictions have adopted their own version of the NAIC model \u201cUnfair Trade Practices Act.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This Act gives the head of each state insurance department the power to investigate insurance\n\ncompanies and producers.\n\n\u2022 It authorizes them to issue cease and desist orders and impose penalties.\n\n\u2022 The Act also gives officers the authority to seek a court injunction to restrain unfair activities, such as\n\nmisrepresentation and false advertising, coercion and intimidation, and unfair discrimination.\n\nNAIC ADVERTISING CODE\n\n\u2022 Many states also subscribe to the NAIC\u2019s Model Advertising Code, which labels certain words and\n\nphrases as misleading by their very nature.\n\n\u2022 These misleading words or phrases can never be used in any insurance advertisement.\n\nThe National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL)\n\n\u2022 In 1969, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL) was formed. The NCOIL\u2019s\n\nprincipal membership is comprised of state legislators from around the nation that serve on state insurance and financial institutions committees.\n\n\u2022 As with the NAIC, NCOIL works to preserve state regulation of the industry, but it also works to\n\neducate public policymakers on related issues.\n\n\u2022 NCOIL also writes model laws.\n\nTHE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS\n\n(NAIFA)and The National Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU)\n\n\u2022 These organizations created a Code of Ethics which details the expectations of agents in their duties toward clients.",

      "content": "\u2022 In generic terms, insurance is defined as the transfer of risk from one party to another in exchange for\n\na fee (premium) by means of a legal contract.\n\n\u2022 Insurance spreads each insured\u2019s risk of loss across many people participating in an insurance\n\ncompany\u2019s risk pool by paying a premium.\n\n\u2022 Insurance reduces financial risk and spreads the risk of loss from one individual to many.\n\nPrinciple of Indemnity (Indemnification)\n\n\u2022 Operating on the \u201cPrinciple of Indemnification,\u201d the goal of an insurance carrier is to \u201crestore\u201d\n\ninsureds to their original financial position following losses.\n\n\u2022 The same principle stipulates that insureds will not profit or gain by their losses. In other words, they\n\nwill not receive more than they lost.\n\n\u2022 Most accident, health, property, and casualty insurance contracts are all contracts of indemnity.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers (Spread of Risk) The law of large numbers holds that, based on experience, the greater the number of homogenous loss exposures, the more likely the overall likelihood of loss can be predicted.\n\n\u2022 The law of large numbers does NOT predict whether an individual suffers a loss.\n\n\u2022 The law of large numbers helps predict the losses that those in the risk pool will suffer in the\n\naggregate.\n\n\u2022 For example, let\u2019s assume that a carrier insures one million people against accidental death. In this case, the carrier is more likely to accurately predict the number of accidental deaths than a company that insures only 1,000 people against the same peril.\n\nADVERSE SELECTION\n\n\u2022 Adverse selection is defined as the tendency for higher-than-average risks to seek out insurance more\n\nfrequently than those who are lower risk.\n\n\u2022 If an insurer suffers a financial loss due to adverse selection, it has inaccurately calculated the risk of\n\nloss and consequently charged inadequate premiums. Companies must avoid adverse selection to be profitable and stay in business. Sound and competent underwriting may reduce the chance of adverse selection.\n\nPerils, Loss, and Hazards Perils (CAUSES of Loss)\n\n\u2022 A peril is the immediate and specific cause of a loss. Each line of insurance covers a different set of perils and losses.\n\n\u2022 Accident and health insurance policies cover losses that are caused by illnesses and accidents.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u25e6 For life insurance and annuities, the primary covered peril is death.\n\n\u2022 Life insurance protects against premature death.\n\n\u2022 Annuities protect income when a person\u2019s life span is greater than the statistical average, and the\n\ninsured would otherwise outlive his assets.\n\nNAMED PERILS VERSUS SPECIAL (OPEN) PERILS\n\n\u2022 Insurance contracts that cover Specified or Named Perils will individually list perils that they cover.\n\n\u2022 If a loss is caused by a peril that\u2019s not listed within the insurance policy, then the loss is not covered. For example, an accidental death and dismemberment policy only covers certain losses, and only those due to accidents. By naming and defining specific causes of loss, a named- peril policy defines covered losses narrowly.\n\n\u2022 Insurance contracts that use a Special or Open Peril definition of covered causes of loss offer insurance that protects against a broad spectrum of potential losses. These policies start by stating that they cover all direct causes of loss and then list any excluded perils.\n\n\u2022 Any peril that\u2019s not explicitly excluded is covered. For example, an individual disability income policy covers losses due to either illnesses or accidents. They also cover job-related losses as well as those that are not.",

      "content": "Loss\n\n\u2022 A loss is defined as an unintended and unforeseen reduction or destruction of financial or economic value.\n\n\u2022 A loss can also be defined as either an accident or an occurrence.\n\n\u2022 An accident is an unforeseen, unexpected, unintended, and sudden event, which occurs at a specific time and specific place.\n\n\u2022 An occurrence is any event that causes a loss. Occurrences include accidents, illnesses, and losses that are caused by repeated or continuous exposure to conditions over time.\n\n[EXAM TIP: Every accident is an occurrence, but not every occurrence is an accident.]\n\n\u2022 A Direct Loss results when a person is hurt, killed, or property is damaged or destroyed.\n\n\u2022 The peril is the proximate cause of the direct loss.\n\n\u2022 An Indirect Loss is also referred to as a \u201cConsequential Loss\u201d because the loss results from a direct loss. For example, if an individual suffers an injury that causes her to be disabled for six months, her injury is a direct loss. The individual\u2019s loss of income, which occurs because the injury results in her inability to work, is indirect.\n\n\u2022 Loss exposure is the risk of a possible loss. Basically, any situation that presents the possibility of a loss.\n\n\u2022 Homogeneous exposure units are similar objects of insurance exposed to the same group of perils.\n\n\u2022 A loss exposure consists of loss exposure units. Hazards\n\n\u2022 A hazard increases the possibility that a loss will occur. Examples of hazards include icy roads, driving while intoxicated, and improperly stored toxic waste.\n\n\u2022 There are three types of hazards\u2014physical hazards, moral hazards, and morale hazards.\n\n\u2022 Physical hazards are physical or tangible conditions existing in a manner that makes a loss more likely to occur. Poor health and ice on roads are examples of physical hazards.\n\n\u2022 Moral hazards make a loss more likely to occur due to the dishonest character of the insured.\n\n\u2022 Properly defined, a moral hazard occurs when the insured is much more intentioned and conscious of participating in wrongdoing that\u2019s more likely to lead to a loss. For example, a dishonest person is more likely to lie to their insurance company, both on an application and when submitting a claim. Negative habits such as drug use, alcohol abuse, and smoking are commonly associated with moral hazards.\n\n\u2022 Morale hazards arise from a state of mind related to the indifference of an insured to whatever loss may occur.\n\n\u2022 The insured unintentionally creates a loss situation because he doesn\u2019t care about loss prevention since the property is insured.\n\nRisk\n\n\u2022 Risk is defined as the potential or uncertainty for loss.\n\nTYPES OF RISK\n\n\u2022 Speculative risks are not insurable because they offer the opportunity for gains as well as losses.\n\n\u2022 Pure risks are insurable because there\u2019s only the potential for loss, not gain.\n\n\u2022 Elements of an\n\nINSURABLE RISK\n\n\u2022 In general, insurable risk must include the following elements:\n\n\u25e6 An insurable loss must be due to chance (accidental), which means that the cause must be\n\n\u2022 outside of an insured\u2019s control. This characteristic helps insurers avoid adverse selection.\n\n\u25e6 An insurable loss must be definite and measurable, which means that the time, place, and\n\n\u2022 amount are known.\n\n\u25e6 An insurable loss must be predictable, which means that the probability of loss in the future can\n\n\u2022 be calculated. There must be a sufficient number of homogeneous loss exposure units to do so.\n\n\u25e6 An insurable loss cannot be catastrophic, which means that a loss cannot be too big or\n\n\u2022 uncertain to calculate. The loss exposure must be reasonable.\n\n\u25e6 The loss exposure to be insured must be substantial.\n\n\u25e6 The premium cost must be economically feasible; it must be small relative to the covered loss\n\n\u2022 exposure.\n\nINSURANCE RISK CLASSIFICATIONS\n\n\u2022 Typically, an insurer will place a risk into one of the following three classifications:",

Substandard risks may either pay a higher premium for coverage or be declined altogether.\n\n\u25e6 Preferred risks are judged to be a better than average risk for an insurance company because\n\n\u2022 they have a lower-than-average potential for loss.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n\u2022 The process of analyzing exposures that create risk and designing programs to handle them is referred\n\nto as risk management.\n\n\u2022 Risk may be reduced or managed by purchasing an insurance contract.\n\nMETHODS OF HANDLING RISK\n\n\u2022 Risk avoidance means eliminating an activity or condition that exposes a person to a type of loss or\n\nspecific perils.\n\n\u2022 Risk reduction is the process of taking deliberate actions to reduce the likelihood or severity of a loss.\n\n\u2022 Risk retention is a conscious strategy of maintaining reserves to address the risk of losses.\n\n\u2022 Risk transfer features a legal contract that transfers risk from one party to another. In general,\n\ninsurance contracts are risk transfer arrangements. They transfer the risk of loss defined in the policy to the insurer in exchange for a known fee or premium.\n\n\u2022 Risk-sharing spreads risk among multiple parties. Each party assumes a portion of the risks covered\n\nby the arrangement, such as with reciprocal insurance companies.\n\n\u2022 Risk pooling spreads risk by distributing the cost of possible losses over a large number of\n\nindividuals. It transfers risk from an individual to a group.\n\n\u2022 Reinsurance is defined as the transfer of risk from one insurer to one or more other insurers.\n\nPrevention\n\n\u2022 Another risk management tool that\u2019s available is loss prevention. Loss prevention involves taking\n\nactions to eliminate damage or loss.",

      "content": "GENERAL LAW OF CONTRACTS\n\n\u2022 Insurance contracts are binding legal agreements between two parties\u2014a policyowner and insurer. In most cases, the policyowner is also the insured. Some life insurance policies are not owned by the person being insured.\n\n\u2022 If an insurance exam asks for the identity of the party that enters into an agreement with an insurance company when buying a policy, the proper answer is \u201cthe policyowner,\u201d even if \u201cthe insured\u201d is also given as a choice.\n\n\u2022 The only time \u201cthe insured\u201d is the correct answer is when \u201cpolicyowner\u201d (or \u201cpolicyholder\u201d) is not given as a possible answer.\n\n\u2022 The beneficiary is not a party to the contract.\n\n\u2022 The following four essential elements must be contained in every contract for it to be legally valid and binding (enforceable). We can remember them using the mnemonic \u201cC.L.O.C.\u201d.\n\n\u2022 1. Competent parties 2. Legal purpose 3. Offer and acceptance 4. Consideration\n\n\u2022 The four elements can be remembered using the mnemonic \u201cC, L, O, C.\u201d\n\nCOMPETENT PARTIES\n\n\u2022 The parties to the contract must be legally competent and must possess the capacity to make binding\n\nagreements.\n\n\u2022 The parties must be mentally sound, sober, of sufficient age, and not disqualified on other legal grounds.\n\n\u2022 Individuals that may be barred from entering into a legally binding contract include:\n\n\u25e6 Minors as defined by state law\n\n\u25e6 Insane or mentally incompetent individuals\n\n\u25e6 Individuals who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of application\n\n\u25e6 Persons who are forced or coerced into a contract\n\n\u25e6 Enemy aliens\n\n\u25e6 Convicts (based on state law) Legal Purpose\n\n\u2022 For a contract to be enforceable, the contract must have a legal purpose. The object of the contract\n\nand the reason for the parties to enter into the agreement must be legal.\n\nOFFER AND ACCEPTANCE\n\n\u2022 Both parties to the insurance contract must agree to the contract terms before they become valid and\n\nin-force.\n\n\u2022 The first party that commits to the contract is offering to enter into a legally binding agreement.\n\n\u2022 The second party\u2019s commitment is legally considered an acceptance of the offer.\n\n\u2022 An offer plus an acceptance is often referred to as the agreement.\n\n\u2022 When the applicant for an insurance policy submits a completed application and pays the initial\n\npremium, she\u2019s making an offer. When the insurer issues the policy as requested, it accepts the offer.\n\n\u2022 If a consumer submits an application without an initial premium, the consumer is NOT making an\n\noffer because no transaction can be completed without the payment of the initial premium. Instead, the consumer is asking the insurer to make an offer by issuing a policy. The consumer accepts the offer by paying the initial premium. Consideration\n\n\u2022 For any agreement to be binding, both parties must provide each other with some item of value, which\n\nis the definition of \u201cconsideration.\u201d\n\n\u2022 An applicant\u2019s consideration is the premium paid and the representations (i.e., statements) made.\n\n\u2022 The insurer\u2019s consideration is the promise to pay legitimate claims.\n\n\u2022 Consideration is the binding force of any insurance policy.",

      "content": "SPECIAL FEATURES OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS ALEATORY CONTRACT\n\n\u2022 An insurance contract is an aleatory contract because one party may recover more in value than he has paid.\n\n\u2022 The value of the policyowner\u2019s potential benefit (i.e., claim payment) is generally higher than the value (i.e., premium) that\u2019s received by the insurer.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no guarantee that the insured will receive a benefit. Performance is based on an uncertain future event involving unequal bargaining value. For example, an individual who has a disability insurance policy will collect benefits if she becomes disabled. However, if no disability occurs, benefits are not paid. Another example illustrating the aleatory nature of insurance contracts is a life insurance policy that pays out a $20,000 death benefit after only $100 of premiums were collected.\n\nCONTRACT OF ADHESION\n\n\u2022 Insurance policies are contracts of adhesion.\n\n\u2022 They\u2019re contracts that are prepared by only one of the parties\u2014the insurance company.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no negotiation regarding the terms. The insurer sets the terms, and the applicant can either \u201ctake it or leave it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 In any contract of adhesion, the party that dictates the contract terms must make those terms clear.\n\n\u2022 The doctrine regarding ambiguities in a contract of adhesion favors the party that did not create the contract terms. When it comes to insurance policies, the courts will rule in favor of the insured.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u25e6 The doctrine of reasonable expectations stipulates that an insurance contract may be interpreted by a\n\n\u201creasonable\u201d consumer to mean what the producer or insurer has indicated it means or what he has interpreted or expected it to mean.\n\nUNILATERAL CONTRACT\n\n\u2022 Insurance policies are unilateral contracts because only the insurer makes an enforceable promise.\n\n\u2022 Insurers promise to pay benefits upon the occurrence of a specific event, such as death or disability.\n\n\u2022 The applicant makes no promise to continue the policy and can cancel it at any time.\n\n\u2022 The insurer\u2019s promise remains in force as long as the policyowner pays the required premium.\n\n\u2022 Most forms of insurance are personal contracts because they\u2019re non-transferrable.\n\n\u2022 Insurance contracts always insure a person, even when they insure property. A homeowner\u2019s policy\n\ndoesn\u2019t merely cover a house; it also covers the person who owns the house. When the person sells the house, the coverage cannot be transferred to the new owner.\n\n\u2022 Life insurance is an exception to this rule. Life insurance is NOT a personal contract.\n\n\u2022 Life insurance contracts can be treated as financial assets. They can be used collateral for loans and\n\ncan be sold to third parties under the terms of a viatical or senior settlement.\n\nCONDITIONAL CONTRACT\n\n\u2022 Insurance policies are conditional contracts because the insurance company\u2019s performance is\n\ncontingent on the occurrence of uncertain future events.\n\n\u2022 The insurer must only fulfill its promise to pay if a covered loss occurs while the policy is in force.\n\n\u2022 The insurer\u2019s obligations under the contract are conditioned on the performance of specific acts by the\n\ninsured or the beneficiary. For example, the insured must provide notice of claim and proof of loss.\n\nVALUED CONTRACT OR INDEMNITY CONTRACT\n\n\u2022 Insurance policies indemnify an insured in one of two ways. Some policies have a fixed value, while\n\nothers have benefits that are tied to the loss of assets, income, or health.\n\n\u2022 A valued contract, such as life insurance, pays a stated sum regardless of the actual loss incurred.\n\n\u2022 An indemnity contract pays an amount which is equal to a loss that\u2019s identified in the policy.\n\n\u2022 Some contracts of indemnity are reimbursement policies that directly reimburse the insured for claim-\n\nrelated expenses.\n\n\u2022 Other indemnity contracts define their benefits as a certain amount of money per day, week, or month\n\nto offset a loss of revenue (as in a disability policy) or some portion of periodic expenses (such as long-term care).\n\nINSURABLE INTEREST\n\n\u2022 Insurable interest can be defined as the kind of financial interest a person must have in themselves or\n\nanother person to purchase legally enforceable insurance coverage.",

Conversely, she will suffer a financial loss if the person becomes ill, suffers an injury, or dies.\n\nNEGOTIATING AND ISSUING INSURANCE POLICIES\n\n\u2022 An insurance policy is a written contract in which one party promises to compensate another against loss from an unknown event.\n\n\u2022 A policy rider or endorsement is a legal attachment which amends a policy.\n\nUTMOST GOOD FAITH\n\n\u2022 Utmost good faith means that the policyowner and the insurer both know all of the relevant information that\u2019s material to the agreement. The critical concept is full disclosure.\n\nREASONABLE EXPECTATIONS\n\n\u2022 The Doctrine of Reasonable Expectations is the legal principle which stipulates that the terms of contracts should be interpreted as may reasonably be expected when ambiguous. Warranty\n\n\u2022 A warranty is a statement that\u2019s guaranteed to be true in every respect. It becomes part of the contract and can be grounds for revoking the agreement if found to be untrue. Representation\n\n\u2022 A representation is a statement which is made by the applicant and is considered to be true and accurate to the best of the applicant\u2019s belief.\n\n\u2022 A false statement made by an applicant that would influence an insurer in determining whether to accept the risk is considered a material misrepresentation. Concealment\n\n\u2022 Concealment is defined as the failure or neglect by the applicant to disclose a known, material fact.\n\n\u2022 An insurance company has the right to rescind the insurance contract in response to either an intentional or unintentional concealment.\n\n\u2022 The insurer must prove the concealment exists and that it\u2019s material to the insurance policy.\n\n\u2022 Void versus\n\nVOIDABLE CONTRACTS\n\n\u2022 For example, if a life insurance applicant asks his friend to impersonate him during a medical\n\nexam in hopes of qualifying for coverage, any resulting policy would be void. It would never be in\n\neffect because the insurance company doesn\u2019t have the right person\u2019s consideration. Also, it\n\ndoesn\u2019t have medical data about the applicant which is necessary to underwrite the policy.\n\n\u2022 The injured party may have the right to terminate the agreement.\n\nFRAUD\n\n\u2022 Fraud is an intentional misrepresentation regarding a claim or policy application that a consumer\n\nmakes to obtain benefit payments or policy coverage under false pretenses.\n\n\u2022 Life insurance contracts cannot be voided after they have been in force for two years. After two years,\n\nthe policies become incontestable.\n\n\u2022 Guaranteed renewable health insurance policies usually have two or three years, depending on state\n\nlaw. After this time, they also become incontestable.\n\n\u2022 The ability of insurers to void other health insurance policies due to fraud is not necessarily limited.\n\nThis will be addressed in the section titled \u201cTime Limit on Certain Defenses.\u201d\n\nPAROLE EVIDENCE RULE\n\n\u2022 The parole evidence rule limits a contract to its written terms. Oral statements that are made before\n\nthe formation of a contract are not admissible in court unless they become part of the written contract.\n\nWAIVER\n\n\u2022 A waiver is the voluntary surrendering (giving up) of a known right.\n\n\u2022 A waiver is also defined as \u201cthe deliberate, voluntary, or intentional abandonment of a known right by\n\nan insurer.\u201d\n\n\u2022 One example of an insurer waiving a right occurs if an incomplete application is mistakenly accepted.\n\nOnce the policy is issued, the insurer cannot contest a later claim based on the missing information.\n\nESTOPPEL\n\n\u2022 Estoppel requires an insurer to abide by misleading or incorrect statements that are made by one of its\n\nagents, even if it can demonstrate that the governing policy form contradicts the agent.\n\n\u2022 Under certain circumstances, this legal principle prevents the insurer from escaping the consequences",

Principles of\n\nAGENCY LAW\n\n\u2022 The four essential principles of agency law include: 1. Acts of an agent are equal to the acts of the principal. 2. Under law, a contract that\u2019s completed by an agent is also completed by the principal. 3. Payments that are received by an agent for the principal are received by the principal. 4. If an agent knows it, it\u2019s presumed that the insurance company does as well.\n\nAGENT AUTHORITY\n\n\u2022 \u201cAuthority\u201d is what an insurer grants a licensee to transact insurance on its behalf.\n\n\u2022 In reality, an agent\u2019s authority can be quite broad. Express Authority Express authority is the agent\u2019s authority which is expressly granted in his agency contract.\n\n\u2022 The principal deliberately gives this authority to one or more agents.\n\n\u2022 For example, an agent has the express authority to bind coverage for applicants on behalf of the company. Implied Authority Implied authority describes the authority we assume an agent needs to transact the principal\u2019s business as expressed in the contract.\n\n\u2022 Implied authority is incidental to express authority.\n\n\u2022 Implied authority encompasses the little things an agent needs to do to accomplish the tasks expressly assigned to him under the terms of his agent contract. Apparent Authority Apparent authority is the appearance of authority regardless of whether it actually exists.\n\n\u2022 Apparent authority relies on the perception of an agent\u2019s authority based on the actions, words, or deeds of the principal.\n\n\u2022 Brokers versus Agents\n\n\u2022 Insurance producers may be agents or brokers.\n\n\u2022 An agent has an agent\u2019s contract, while a broker has a broker\u2019s contract.\n\n\u2022 In a sales transaction, agents represent the insurer, but brokers represent the buyer (or applicant).\n\n\u2022 A broker cannot bind coverage; however, an agent can.\n\nAGENT VERSUS SOLICITOR AUTHORITY\n\n\u2022 Some states license solicitors.\n\n\u2022 Solicitors have the authority to seek out insurance applicants for a company, but don\u2019t have any\n\nauthority to bind coverage on behalf of a company.\n\n\u2022 Solicitors arrange for prospective clients to meet with an agent.\n\n\u2022 Agents are authorized to handle all of the necessary steps of an insurance sale, from solicitation to\n\nsales to taking and binding an application.

Typically, group life insurance doesn\u2019t require evidence of\n\ninsurability and is cheaper than individual life insurance.\n\nOrdinary life comprises several types of individual life insurance, such as temporary (term) and\n\npermanent (whole).\n\nTerm life insurance gives a person the most considerable amount of coverage for a limited period. Term\n\ninsurance is only in effect for a limited period because it has a TERMination date. Term insurance is an\n\ninexpensive type of insurance, which makes it an attractive option for policies with a significant face\n\nvalue. Term life is the CHEAPEST type of pure life insurance due to the fact that it has a termination date\n\nand doesn\u2019t have any cash value. Term life insurance will ALWAYS be cheaper than a whole life policy\n\nwith the same face value. It provides pure death protection since it only pays a death benefit if the insured\n\ndies during the policy term.\n\nLevel term insurance, also referred to as level premium level term, requires a fixed, low premium in\n\nexchange for level protection that lasts a specified period. For example, if a person needs life insurance\n\nthat provides coverage for the remainder of her working years and wants to pay as little as possible, she\n\nwill need Level term.\n\nLevel term life insurance is often renewal and convertible. For example, a person has a 10-year renewable\n\nand convertible term policy. At the conclusion of the 10 years, the policy terminates, or she can renew it. If\n\nshe renews it, the premium price will go up, and she will have the policy for another 10 years. This cycle\n\ncan continue until she\u2019s too old to renew it or it\u2019s too expensive. All TERM insurance has a final\n\nTERMINATION date after which it can no longer be renewed. If the policy is CONVERTIBLE, a person\n\ncan CONVERT it to whole life (think, rent to own) at any time. Whenever a person renews or converts\n\nANY insurance, she doesn\u2019t need to worry about her health (i.e., her insurability is locked in). However,\n\nthe price will always rise because her current (attained) age is used for your new policy. Term life\n\ninsurance is typically thought of as \u201crenting.\u201d The concept is that a person has a roof over her head, but the\n\nprice of renting is going to rise until it no longer makes sense to continue renting or, at some point, the\n\nrental contract is TERMINATED, and she gets kicked out.\n\nPremiums are initially higher for non-renewable level term insurance than renewable term life insurance\n\nbecause they\u2019re level throughout the policy period. However, with renewable term insurance, the\n\npremiums will increase at each renewal and eventually exceed those of standard level term insurance.\n\n\u2022 Decreasing term life insurance provides an annually decreasing face amount over time with level\n\npremiums. A decreasing term policy is a type of life policy with a death benefit that adjusts periodically\n\n(according to a schedule) and is written for a specific period. Decreasing term policies are generally\n\nwritten for the protection of a mortgage or other debt that typically decreases over time until it\u2019s paid\n\noff. For example, a 15-year decreasing term policy could protect a 15-year mortgage. As the mortgage\n\nbalance reduces each year, the face value of the insurance policy will adjust accordingly to match. After\n\nTHE MORTGAGE IS PAID OFF, THE INSURANCE POLICY WILL EXPIRE.\n\nCredit policies are typically purchased using a decreasing term life insurance policy, with a term that\u2019s\n\nmatched to the length of the loan period and the decreasing insurance amount matched to the declining\n\nloan balance. Since credit life insurance is designed to cover the life of a debtor and pay the amount",

      "content": "due on a loan if the debtor dies before the loan is repaid, credit policies can only be purchased for up to\n\nthe amount of the debt or loan outstanding. For example, if a person wants an insurance policy to protect a\n\n$20,000, five-year auto loan, he could use a five-year decreasing term life insurance policy with an initial\n\nface value of $20,000. He will pay the same level premium every month for the five-year term of the\n\npolicy. The face value will start at $20,000 and change according to a schedule (the auto loan). After five\n\nyears, the car will be paid off, and the insurance policy will no longer be needed.\n\nIncreasing term life insurance provides an increasing face amount over time based on specific amounts\n\nOR A PERCENTAGE OF THE ORIGINAL FACE AMOUNT.\n\nConvertible term life insurance policies have a provision that allows the policyowner to convert the\n\nterm insurance into a permanent insurance policy without proof of insurability. For example, John\n\ntook out a low-cost term life insurance policy when he was young to take advantage of his excellent\n\nhealth. Knowing that the policy would eventually terminate, John wanted the option to convert the policy\n\nto a permanent one for final expense benefits when his finances improve. The conversion privilege of a\n\ngroup term life policy allows an individual to leave the group term (temporary) plan and convert his\n\ninsurance to an individual (permanent) policy without providing evidence of insurability.\n\nTerm life insurance policies are typically converted using the insured\u2019s attained (current) age, not the age\n\nof the insured at the time of the original application. The insured\u2019s age is a primary factor for calculating\n\npremium costs. Therefore, using the insured\u2019s current (attained) age will result in higher premiums than\n\nusing the insured\u2019s original age. For example, a $25,000 policy on a healthy seven-year-old boy will cost\n\nsubstantially less than a $25,000 policy on a 57-year-old man.\n\nWhether converting an individual or group term insurance policy, the insured\u2019s insurability is guaranteed.\n\nHowever, the cost of the policy will be based on her current (attained) age, not the age when she applied\n\nfor the original term policy. Convertible term insurance allows the insured to enroll in temporary coverage\n\nand later change it to permanent coverage without insurability (good health). However, the premiums will\n\nINCREASE DUE TO USING THE INSURED\u2019S ATTAINED AGE.\n\nRenewable term insurance guarantees the insured the right to continue term coverage after the expiration\n\nof the initial policy period without proving insurability. When a term policy is renewed, the insured is\n\nnot required to prove insurability. However, the premium price will rise because the insurance company\n\nwill use the insured\u2019s current or attained age to determine the new premiums. If a customer wants\n\ncoverage at the lowest possible cost that was good for a limited period but offers the ability to continue the\n\ncoverage after the expiration, the customer will want a renewable term policy.\n\nAnnual renewable term coverage provides a level face amount that renews annually. This type of\n\ncoverage is guaranteed renewable annually without proof of insurability.\n\nWhole life insurance provides a permanent death benefit for the entire life of the insured, but it also\n\nprovides living benefits in the form of cash values and policy loans. Whole life insurance typically has a\n\nlevel premium and matures once the insured attains the age of 100.\n\nAdvantages of whole life insurance:\n\n\u2022 Covers the entire life of the insured\n\n\u2022 Living benefits \u2013 cash value and policy loans\n\n\u2022 Fixed premiums\n\nDrawbacks of whole life insurance:\n\n\u2022 Protection is more expensive than term insurance because of the policy\u2019s living benefits\n\n\u2022 Premium paying period may extend beyond the income-earning years\n\nWhole life is often compared to BUYING (e.g., BUYING a house). The idea is a person can pay off a\n\nhouse slowly or quickly; however, regardless of how it\u2019s paid, once it\u2019s paid for, the person owns the\n\nhouse. There are several types of whole life. All whole life policies have the same types of benefits. The\n\nonly difference in \u201ctypes\u201d of whole life is how the policy is paid. All whole life policies last until death or",

As the premium payment period shortens, the total cost for the insured decreases, and the policy\u2019s cash values increase faster. For example, under a life paid- up at age 65 policy, premiums are only paid until the insured is 65 years old. With a 20-pay life policy, the insured only pays for 20 years. All policy provisions and insurability being equal, a 40- year-old insured would pay more for the 20-pay life than she would for a paid-up at age 65 policy. Additionally, her cash value would accumulate at a faster rate. Both of these policies are in effect until the insured\u2019s death or until she reaches the age of 100.\n\n\u2022 Single premium whole life: Allows the insured to pay the entire premium in one lump-sum and have coverage for her entire life.\n\n\u25e6 An immediate non-forfeiture value is created\n\n\u25e6 Immediate cash value is created\n\n\u25e6 A large part of the premium is used to set up the policy\u2019s reserve\n\n\u2022 Modified whole life: This type has low premiums in the early years and jumps to a higher premium in the later years but remains fixed after that. Premiums increase just once.\n\n\u2022 Graded whole life: Under a typical graded premium life insurance policy, the premium increases yearly for a stated number of years, then remains level. Premiums continue to stay level for the remainder of the policy. For example, a policy can start low in a graded whole life insurance policy and increase a small amount every year up until the fifth year, then it will level off for the remainder of the policy.\n\nSPECIAL USE POLICIES\n\nIn addition to the basic types of life insurance policies, there are a number of \u201cspecial use\u201d policies\n\ninsurance companies offer. Many of these are a combination (or package) of different policy types and are\n\nDESIGNED TO SERVE A VARIETY OF NEEDS.\n\nFamily plan policies are designed to insure all family members under one policy. Usually, the family\n\nhead is covered by permanent (whole life) insurance, and the spouse/children are included on the same\n\nPOLICY AS LEVEL TERM LIFE RIDERS (FAMILY TERM RIDERS).\n\nThe term coverage on the spouse and children is typically convertible to permanent coverage without\n\nevidence of insurability as long as it\u2019s \u201cattached\u201d to another person\u2019s policy. Think sidecar on a\n\nMOTORCYCLE. RIDERS MUST RIDE ON SOMETHING.\n\nFamily plan policy example:\n\n\u2022 Husband \u2013 Whole Life Policy\n\n\u2022 Wife (spouse) \u2013 Term Policy which is convertible without proof of insurability\n\n\u2022 Children \u2013 Term Policies which are convertible (typically at the age of 18 or 21) without proof of insurability; premium remains the same regardless of the number of children\n\nFamily income policies combine whole life insurance and decreasing term insurance. It provides monthly\n\nincome to a beneficiary if death occurs during a specified period after the date of purchase. If the insured\n\ndies after the specified period, only the face value is paid to the beneficiary since the decreasing term\n\ninsurance expired. Income needs typically DECREASE over time because the household debt shrinks.\n\nFamily maintenance policies combine whole life insurance and level term. They provide income to a\n\nbeneficiary for a selected period if an insured dies during that period. At the end of the income-paying\n\nperiod, the beneficiary also receives the entire face amount of the policy. If an insured dies after the end of\n\nthe selected period, the beneficiary receives only the face value of the whole life policy. Maintenance\n\n\u201cmaintains\u201d the family using level term insurance. This means that the family will receive a benefit for a\n\nPRESET NUMBER OF YEARS AFTER THE INSURED\u2019S DEATH.",

      "content": "Multiple protection policies pay a benefit of double or triple the face amount if death occurs during a\n\nspecified period. If death occurs after the period has expired, only the policy face amount is paid. The\n\nperiod may be for a specified number of years (e.g., 10, 15, or 20 years) or to a specified age (e.g., the age\n\nof 65). These policies are combinations of permanent insurance and level term insurance.\n\nJoint life policies cover two or more people. The age of the insureds is averaged, and a single premium is\n\ncharged. It uses permanent insurance (as opposed to term) and pays a death benefit when one of the\n\ninsureds dies. The survivors then have the option of purchasing an individual policy without evidence of\n\ninsurability. The premium for a joint life policy is less than the premium for separate, multiple policies.\n\nONE policy covers two. This is similar to a \u201cjoint account\u201d with a bank \u2013 one account (or policy, in this\n\nCASE) FOR TWO PEOPLE.\n\nA variation of the joint life policy is the joint and survivor policy, or a \u201csurvivorship life policy\u201d (it can\n\nalso be referred to as a \u201csecond to die\u201d policy). This plan also covers two lives, but the benefit is paid upon\n\nthe death of the last surviving insured. Compared to the combined premium for separate life insurance\n\npolicies on two individuals, the premium for a survivorship life policy is lower.\n\nJuvenile Insurance is life insurance written on the life of a minor. The adult applicant is typically the\n\npremium payor until the child comes of age and can take over the payments.\n\nCredit life insurance is designed to cover the life of a debtor and pay the amount due on a loan if the\n\ndebtor dies before the loan is repaid. It\u2019s issued in an amount that\u2019s not to exceed the outstanding loan\n\nbalance and is generally paid entirely by the borrower. A decreasing term policy is most often used.\n\nNON-TRADITIONAL LIFE POLICIES\n\nInterest-Sensitive Whole Life: Interest-sensitive life insurance (current assumption whole life insurance)\n\nis a type of whole life insurance in which the cash value can increase beyond the stated guarantee if\n\neconomic conditions warrant. It also allows the insured to increase the face amount or use the extra cash\n\nvalue to lower future premiums. Premiums can vary to reflect the insurer\u2019s changing assumptions\n\nconcerning its death, investment, and expense factors. CAWL (current assumption whole life) policies are\n\nALMOST ALWAYS AN MEC DUE TO ACCELERATED PREMIUMS.\n\nAdjustable life policies are distinguished by their flexibility from combining term and whole life\n\ninsurance into a single plan. The policyowner determines how much protection is needed and how much\n\npremium he\u2019s willing to pay. Adjustable life insurance allows a person to vary his coverage as his needs\n\nchange without requiring evidence of insurability. Consequently, no new policy needs to be issued when\n\nchanges are desired. Adjustable life has all the usual features of whole life insurance.\n\nUniversal life is a variation of whole life insurance and is characterized by considerable flexibility.\n\nChanges may be made with relative ease by the policyowner with these flexible-premium policies.\n\nInvestment gains go toward the cash value. Unlike whole life (with its fixed premiums, fixed face\n\namounts, and fixed cash value accumulations), universal life allows its policyowners to determine the\n\namount and frequency of premium payments, which will adjust the policy face amount. Essential\n\ncharacteristics of a universal life policy are flexible premiums, flexible benefits, no minimum death\n\nbenefit, and cash value withdrawals. Cash value accumulations are subject to a minimum interest\n\nguarantee. Any surrender charges of a universal policy must be disclosed.\n\nEquity Index Universal Life insurance (EIUL) is a permanent life insurance policy that allows\n\npolicyholders to tie accumulation values to a stock market index, such as the S&P 500. Indexed universal\n\nlife insurance policies typically contain a minimum guaranteed fixed interest rate component and the\n\nindexed account option. Indexed policies give policyholders the security of fixed universal life insurance\n\nwith the growth potential of a variable policy linked to indexed returns.

The test is designed to discourage premium schedules that result in a paid-up policy before\n\nTHE END OF A SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD.\n\nFor example, if the yearly premium is $500, over seven years, the total amount paid would equal $3,500. If\n\na person paid $3,501, the policy has exceeded the 7-pay test and is no longer a life insurance contract.\n\nInstead, it will be taxed as an investment.\n\n\u2022 If withdrawn before age 59 1/2, there\u2019s a 10% penalty.\n\n\u2022 Taxation only occurs when cash is distributed.\n\n\u2022 Funds that are withdrawn from an MEC are subject to last-in-first-out (LIFO) tax treatment, which assumes that the investment or earnings portion of the contract\u2019s values is withdrawn first (making these funds fully taxable as ordinary income).\n\n\u2022 Penalties and taxes may be assessed on premature distributions (i.e., policy loans) from a modified endowment contract (MEC).\n\nVARIABLE INSURANCE PRODUCTS\n\nDue to the transfer of investment risk from the insurer to the policyowner, variable insurance products are\n\nconsidered both securities contracts and insurance contracts. A producer is required to register with the\n\nNational Association of Securities Dealers to sell variable products.\n\nVariable whole life insurance was created to help offset the effects of inflation on death benefits.\n\nVariable whole life insurance is permanent life insurance with many of the characteristics of traditional\n\nwhole life insurance. The main difference between traditional whole life insurance and variable whole life\n\ninsurance is how the policy\u2019s cash values are invested. With traditional whole life insurance, these values\n\nare kept in the insurer\u2019s general accounts and invested in conservative investments that are selected by the\n\ninsurer to match its contractual guarantees and liabilities. With variable life insurance policies, the policy\n\nvalues are invested in accounts that are separate from the insurer\u2019s general accounts. These accounts allow\n\nthe policyowner the option to direct the investment choice and offer common stock, bond, money market,\n\nand other securities investment options. Values that are held in these separate accounts are invested in\n\nriskier, but potentially higher-yielding, assets than those held in the general account. The primary\n\ncharacteristics of a variable life policy include fixed premiums, a guaranteed minimum death benefit\n\nwhich fluctuates over the minimum, and cash values which fluctuate and are not guaranteed.\n\nVariable universal life (VUL) life insurance combines all the characteristics of universal life and variable\n\nlife. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in various separate accounts, similar to mutual funds. The\n\nchoice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The \u2018variable\u2019\n\ncomponent in the name refers to the ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary because they\u2019re\n\ninvested in the stock and bond markets. The \u2018universal\u2019 component in the name refers to the flexibility the\n\nowner has in making premium payments. Variable universal life insurance provides the policyowner with\n\nflexible premiums, adjustable death benefits, a guaranteed minimum death benefit. It gives the insured\n\ngrowth potential for higher returns and the potential for loss. Evidence of insurability can be required for an\n\nindividual who\u2019s covered by a variable universal life policy when the death benefit is increased.",

However, this doesn\u2019t prevent a mutually agreeable change or modification of the contract after it has been issued.\n\n\u2022 Any change to a policy must be made with the approval of an executive officer of the insurance\n\ncompany whose approval must be endorsed on the policy or attached in a rider.\n\n\u2022 The execution clause states that the insurance contract will be executed when both parties (the insurer\n\nand the policyowner) have satisfied the conditions of the contract.\n\n\u2022 The privilege of change clause (or policy change provision) outlines the conditions under which the\n\ncompany will allow the policyowner to change the policy\u2019s coverage.\n\nInsuring Clause (or Insuring Agreement):\n\n\u2022 The insuring clause is the insurer\u2019s basic promise to pay specified benefits to a designated person in\n\nthe event of a covered loss.\n\n\u2022 This is the part of the insurance policy that identifies the specific type of benefits or services that are\n\ncovered by the policy and the circumstances under which they will be paid.\n\n\u2022 The purpose of this clause in an insurance policy is to specify the scope and limits of the coverage\n\nprovided.\n\n\u2022 Any promises that the INSURER makes will be in the INSURING clause.\n\nConsideration Clause:\n\n\u2022 A policyowner must pay a premium in exchange for the insurer\u2019s promise to pay benefits.\n\n\u2022 A policyowner\u2019s consideration consists of completing the application and paying the initial premium.\n\n\u2022 The amount and frequency of premium payments are contained in the consideration clause. For\n\ninsurance, the insurance company exchanges the promises in the policy for a two-part consideration from the insured.\n\n\u2022 Consideration is an exchange of an item of value on which a contract is based.\n\n\u2022 An insurance contract is valid only if the insured provides consideration in the form of the initial full\n\nminimum premium required and the statements that are made in the application.\n\n\u2022 The applicant states, \u201cPlease CONSIDER me for insurance. Here is my completed application, my\n\ninitial premium, as well as how much money and how often I agree to pay. Please CONSIDER me!\u201d\n\nIncontestable Clause:\n\n\u2022 In a life insurance contract, this is the clause that prohibits the insurer from questioning the validity of\n\nthe contract after a certain period has elapsed.\n\n\u2022 The period is typically two years from the policy\u2019s issue date. Since state requirements may be\n\ndifferent, they will be covered in the state law portion at the end of the course.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM AND AUTOPSY:\n\n\u2022 The physical exam and autopsy provision entitles a company, at its own expense, to make physical\n\nexaminations of the insured at reasonable intervals during the period of a claim, unless it\u2019s forbidden by state law.\n\n\u2022 Only the state can forbid an autopsy. A person (and her family) gives up her right to refuse when she\n\napplies for insurance.\n\nMISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX:\n\n\u2022 Allows the insurer to adjust the policy benefits if the insured\u2019s age or sex is misstated on the policy\n\napplication.\n\n\u2022 The misstatement of age provision allows the insurer to adjust the benefit payable if the age of the\n\ninsured was misstated when the application for the policy was made.\n\n\u2022 The insurer can adjust the benefit to what the premiums paid would have purchased at the insured\u2019s\n\nactual age.\n\n\u2022 At the time of application, if the insured were older than what\u2019s shown in the application, benefits\n\nwould be reduced accordingly.

Under an absolute assignment, the transfer is complete and irrevocable, and the assignee receives full control over the policy and full rights to its benefits.\n\n\u2022 A collateral assignment is the partial and temporary transfer of rights to another person or entity.\n\nCollateral assignments are typically intended for securing a loan with a creditor. A collateral assignment occurs when the policy is assigned to a creditor as security or collateral for a debt. If the insured dies (or possibly becomes totally\\permanently disabled), the creditor is entitled to be reimbursed out of the benefit proceeds for the amount owed. The insured\u2019s beneficiary is then entitled to any excess of policy proceeds over the amount due to the creditor.\n\nFREE LOOK:\n\n\u2022 Once the policy is delivered, the policyowner is permitted a certain number of days to look over the\n\npolicy and, if dissatisfied, return it for a refund of all premiums paid.\n\nGrace Period:\n\n\u2022 The grace period is a specified period after a premium payment is due, during which the protection of\n\nthe policy continues despite the fact that the payment for the renewal premium has not yet been received.\n\n\u2022 The policyowner is given a number of days after the premium due date and, during this time, the\n\npremium payment may be delayed without penalty, and the policy continues in force.\n\n\u2022 If the insured dies during the grace period of a life insurance policy before paying the required annual\n\npremium, the beneficiary will receive the face amount of the policy less any required premiums.\n\n\u2022 The purpose of the grace period is to give the policyowner additional time to pay overdue premiums.\n\nREINSTATEMENT:\n\n\u2022 The reinstatement provision allows the policyowner to reinstate a policy that has lapsed as long as the\n\npolicyowner can provide proof of insurability and pays all back premiums, outstanding loans, and interest.\n\n\u2022 Most states allow reinstatement for up to three years after a policy has lapsed. However, for some\n\nstates the reinstatements are from five to seven years.\n\n\u2022 This provision specifies that if an insured fails to pay a renewal premium within the time granted, but\n\nthe insurer subsequently accepts the premium, coverage may be restored.\n\n\u2022 Under certain conditions, a policy that has lapsed may be reinstated.\n\n\u2022 Reinstatement is automatic if the company or its authorized agent accepts the delinquent premium,\n\nand the company doesn\u2019t require an application for reinstatement. If it takes no action on the application for 45 days, the policy is reinstated automatically.\n\n\u2022 To reinstate any policy, a person needs a reinstatement application, statement of good health, and\n\npayment of all back premiums.\n\nPROVISIONS AND OPTIONS RELATED TO CASH VALUE\n\nNON-FORFEITURE OPTIONS\n\n\u2022 When a policyowner decides he doesn\u2019t want his life insurance policy any longer, he has the option to\n\nsurrender his policy. If there\u2019s cash value remaining, the policyowner must use one of the following non-forfeiture options:\n\n\u25e6 Cash Surrender: Allows the policyowner to receive the policy\u2019s cash value and, at this point,\n\n\u2022 the policyowner no longer has coverage. Typically, the maximum length of time a life insurance company may legally defer paying the cash value of a surrendered policy is six months (delayed payment provision).\n\n\u25e6 Extended Term Option: Permits the policyowner to use the policy\u2019s cash value to buy level,\n\n\u2022 extended term insurance for a specified period. No premium payments are made. The coverage provided with the extended term non-forfeiture option is equal to the net death benefit of the lapsed policy.\n\n\u25e6 Reduced Paid-Up Option: The policyowner pays no more premiums, but the face amount is\n\n\u2022 decreased.\n\n\u2022 If the insured is closing her account (surrendering her policy), the insurance company is questioning",

These policies must\n\nbegin to build cash value after a certain number of years. In most states, the period is three years.\n\n\u2022 Policy loans (with interest) cannot exceed the guaranteed cash value, if so, the policy is no longer in\n\nforce.\n\n\u2022 The policyowner has the right to the policy\u2019s cash value.\n\n\u2022 Policy loans are not taxable.\n\n\u2022 At time of the insured\u2019s death, any loans (with interest due) will be deducted from the insured\u2019s policy\n\nproceeds.\n\nAUTOMATIC PREMIUM LOANS:\n\n\u2022 This provision allows the insurer to automatically use the policy cash value to pay an overdue\n\npremium. Therefore, it allows the insurance company to deduct the overdue premium from an insured\u2019s cash value by the end of the grace period if a payment is missed on a life policy.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no cost associated with this provision.\n\n\u2022 The automatic premium loans provision is similar to using a savings account for overdraft protection,\n\nbut there\u2019s no fee. Instead, there\u2019s simply interest charged for borrowing the funds. If the loan is not repaid, interest is added to the loan.\n\n\u2022 Outstanding loans are subtracted from any death benefit or cash surrenders if they\u2019re not paid back\n\nfirst.\n\n\u2022 The insurance company can AUTOMATICALLY take out a LOAN for the insured against his CASH\n\nVALUE to cover his PREMIUM in the event the company doesn\u2019t\u2019 receive his payment.\n\n\u2022 Automatic premium loans can continue for as long as the insurer doesn\u2019t receive payment and the\n\npolicyowner has cash value remaining in the policy. Once all of the cash value is gone, if the policyowner doesn\u2019t start paying, the policy will lapse.\n\n\u2022 The automatic premium loans function in the same manner as any other cash value loan.\n\nPROVISIONS AND OPTIONS RELATED TO POLICY PROCEEDS\n\nBENEFICIARY DESIGNATION:\n\n\u2022 This is where the policyowner indicates who\u2019s to receive the proceeds.\n\nCHANGE OF BENEFICIARY:\n\n\u2022 The policyowner may change the beneficiary designation at any time unless a beneficiary has been\n\nidentified as irrevocable.\n\nSETTLEMENT OPTIONS:\n\n\u2022 The methods by which the policy proceeds can be paid out or settled.\n\n\u2022 Typically, the beneficiary chooses the settlement option at the time of the insured\u2019s death.\n\n\u2022 The spendthrift clause stipulates that the policyowner may select a settlement option at the time of\n\napplication.\n\nACCELERATED BENEFITS RIDER:\n\n\u2022 This rider allows the insured to receive a portion of the death benefit prior to death if the insured has a\n\nterminal illness and is expected to die within one to two years. Regardless of the amount withdrawn in an accelerated death benefit, it will decrease the death benefit when death occurs.\n\n\u2022 For example, an insurance company may know that a person is going to die soon, which means it\u2019s\n\ngoing to be paying out the benefit soon. To make things a little easier and less stressful, the company will give the insured some of the proceeds NOW and deduct from what would go to the beneficiary upon the insured\u2019s death.\n\nLONG-TERM CARE RIDER:\n\n\u2022 A long-term care rider is a type of accelerated benefits rider that will pay a benefit if the insured is\n\npermanently confined to a nursing home and requires long-term care or is unable to perform two or more activities of daily living.\n\n\u2022 Activities of daily living (ADLs) include eating, dressing, bathing, toileting/continence,\n\nwalking/ambulation, transferring, or taking medication.\n\nPROVISIONS AND OPTIONS RELATED TO POLICY DIVIDENDS\n\nDIVIDENDS:\n\n\u2022 Participating policies pay dividends to policyowners if the company\u2019s operations result in a divisible\n\nsurplus.\n\n\u2022 Dividends are a return of overcharged premiums and are therefore not taxable.\n\n\u2022 Insurers typically pay dividends on an annual basis.\n\nDIVIDEND OPTIONS:\n\n\u2022 The following dividend options are available to policyowners for settling dividend payments:\n\n\u25e6 Cash Option: The insured simply takes the cash.\n\n\u25e6 Reduced Premiums Option: Reduces premium payments by having the insurance company\n\n\u2022 retain the money and charge less the following year.",

Instead, the insurance company is\n\n\u201cwaiving\u201d the premiums\u201d and treating it as if the insured made the premium payments each month.\n\nAccidental Death Benefit Rider (Double Indemnity):\n\n\u2022 This rider may be added to a permanent or temporary life insurance policy.\n\n\u2022 It pays an additional sum to the beneficiary if the insured dies due to an accident.\n\n\u2022 The amount paid is a multiple of the policy face amount, such as double or triple the original benefit.\n\nThis is truly the cheapest way to add a large amount of coverage for a specific period.\n\n\u2022 Provides an additional amount of insurance that\u2019s typically equal to the face amount of the base policy\n\nif the cause of death was the result of an accident.\n\nACCIDENTAL DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT RIDER:\n\n\u2022 This rider may be added to a permanent or temporary life insurance policy, and it pays benefits for\n\ndismemberment and accidental death.\n\n\u2022 It pays a principal sum (face amount) for loss of both hands, both arms, both legs, or loss of vision in\n\nboth eyes.\n\n\u2022 Pays capital sum (half of face value) for loss of one foot, one hand, one eye, etc.\n\n\u2022 One foot and one hand = 100% face value.\n\nGUARANTEED INSURABILITY OPTION RIDER:\n\n\u2022 This rider allows a policyowner to purchase additional life insurance coverage at specified dates\n\nwithout providing evidence of insurability.\n\n\u2022 It also includes specific events (e.g., marriage or birth of a child) without requiring the proof of\n\ninsurability.\n\n\u2022 The benefit is typically allowed every three years, up to the original face amount of the policy.\n\n\u2022 This feature is also referred to as the future increase option.\n\nCOST OF LIVING RIDER:\n\n\u2022 This rider allows the policy face amount to be adjusted to account for inflation based on the Consumer\n\nPrice Index (CPI).\n\nPAYOR PROVISION (RIDER):\n\n\u2022 The payor provision is typically attached to juvenile policies to protects the insured in the event that\n\nthe PAYOR dies or is disabled.\n\n\u2022 With this provision, if the adult premium payor of the juvenile policy dies or becomes disabled, the\n\npremiums will be waived until the child reaches a specified age (e.g., age 18, 21, or 25).\n\n\u2022 This provision is also referred to as the payor clause.\n\nTERM RIDER:\n\n\u2022 A term rider allows an applicant to have excess coverage by adding an additional term rider to her\n\nprimary policy.\n\n\u2022 A term rider is an economical way to add a large amount of additional insurance to a permanent life\n\ninsurance policy.\n\n\u2022 Term riders covering the life of the insured can be level, increasing, or decreasing term.\n\nReturn of Premium Rider:\n\n\u2022 This rider returns the total amount of premiums paid into the policy, in addition to the face value, as\n\nlong as the insured dies within a specific period that\u2019s specified in the policy.\n\n\u2022 It also returns premiums to the living insured at the end of a specified period as long as the premiums\n\nhave been paid.\n\nOTHER INSUREDS PROVISIONS:\n\n\u2022 Other insured or dependent riders may be added to a primary policy to cover a spouse or \u201canother",

Term riders allow for additional family members to be covered under one policy by attaching everyone to the primary policy.\n\nCHILD TERM RIDER:\n\n\u2022 A child term rider is a life insurance product that rides on the primary parent\u2019s policy and covers the\n\nlives of the children.\n\n\u2022 The child term rider is typically one flat premium, regardless of the number of children covered.\n\n\u2022 Remember, a child term rider pays a benefit to the beneficiary (parent) if the child dies; it doesn\u2019t pay\n\nthe child.\n\nSPOUSAL TERM RIDER:\n\n\u2022 A spousal term rider is a life insurance product that rides on the primary policy and covers the life of\n\nthe primary insured\u2019s spouse.\n\n\u2022 Remember, a spouse term rider pays a benefit to the beneficiary (primary insured) if the spouse dies; it\n\ndoesn\u2019t pay the spouse.\n\nCOMMON EXCLUSIONS OR RESTRICTIONS\n\nEXCLUSIONS:\n\n\u2022 An exclusion is a feature of a life insurance policy stating that the policy will not cover certain risks.\n\n\u2022 Exclusions and restrictions are situations or conditions which are not covered or are covered with\n\nsubstantial limits.\n\n\u2022 The exclusions section is NOT included in the policy face (i.e., the first page of an insurance policy).\n\nWAR OR MILITARY SERVICE\n\n\u2022 The insurer will not pay the claim if the insured dies or is injured while in active military service or\n\ndue to an act of war.\n\nAVIATION\n\n\u2022 The insurer will not pay the claim if the insured dies due to involvement with aviation.

      "content": "PROCEEDS, AND BENEFICIARIES PURPOSE OF PREMIUMS\n\n\u2022 The insurer receives a premium from a policyowner in exchange for insurance protection. The\n\npremium is part of the policyowner\u2019s consideration or the \u201cbinding force\u201d in the contract, which cements the agreement between the insurer and policyowner.\n\nFACTORS IN PREMIUM CALCULATION\n\n\u2022 Mortality Factor: A measure of the number of deaths in a given population. Mortality is based on a\n\nlarge risk pool of people and time. Insurance companies use mortality tables to help predict the life expectancy and probability of death for a given group.\n\n\u2022 Interest Factor: Insurance companies invest the premiums they receive in an effort to earn interest.\n\nThe rate of earnings on investments is one of the ways that an insurance company can reduce premium rates.\n\n\u2022 Expense Factor: As any other business, insurance companies have operating expenses that need to\n\nbe factored into the premiums being charged. The expense factor is also referred to as the loading charge.\n\nOTHER FACTORS THAT IMPACT THE PREMIUM AMOUNT\n\n\u2022 Age: The older the person, the higher probability of death and disability.\n\n\u2022 Sex/Gender: Women tend to live longer than men; therefore, their premiums are generally lower.\n\n\u2022 Health: Poor health increases the probability of death and disability.\n\n\u2022 Occupation: A hazardous job increases the risk of loss.\n\n\u2022 Hobbies: High-risk hobbies also increase the risk of loss. Remember, these are typically only\n\nimportant at the time of application. For example, a person is obtaining life insurance and states that he\u2019s never been skydiving (which is true). Then, five years later, the person goes skydiving for the first time and dies in an accident. In this case, the insurance company will pay the death benefit.\n\n\u2022 Habits: Tobacco use presents a higher risk than for non-smokers.\n\n\u2022 Benefits, options, and riders: The number and types of benefits provided by a policy affect the\n\npremium rate. The greater the benefits, the higher the premium. Or, put another way, the greater the risk to the company, the higher the premium.\n\n\u2022 Premium mode refers to the premium payment schedule and permits the policyowner to select the\n\ntiming of premium payments. Options include annual, semiannual, quarterly, and monthly. The more frequently the payments are made, the more it\u2019s going to cost overall. Ideally, if a person is able to make one payment in a lump-sum to start and \u201cpay up\u201d the policy, she will save the most money. Also, her cash value will begin to accumulate immediately. The higher the premium payments, the quicker the cash value will accumulate. The higher the frequency of payments, the higher the total premiums.\n\nPREMIUM TERMS AND FUNDING\n\n\u2022 An insurance company\u2019s reserves represent money that (together with future premiums, interest, and\n\nsurvivorship benefits) will fulfill an insurance company\u2019s obligations to pay future claims. Each state has its own reserve requirements.\n\n\u2022 The earned premium (the amount of premium to which an insurer is entitled for the insurance\n\ncoverage provided) and the unearned premium (the premium collected from the policyholder for future coverage) make up the insurer\u2019s total premium.\n\n\u2022 Cost basis represents the premiums paid into the policy minus total dividends received in cash or used\n\nto offset premiums.\n\n\u2022 Net premium is a premium that makes provision for mortality (death benefit) losses only while being\n\ninfluenced by the interest rate assumed, gender, the benefit to be provided, and the mortality rate.\n\n\u2022 Gross premium is the premium charged by an insurer and is comprised of or influenced by all factors\n\nof mortality, interest, and expenses. It\u2019s the actual premium paid by the policyowner for life insurance coverage. (Gross premium = Net premium + Insurer expenses).\n\n\u2022 Single premium funding: The policyowner pays a single premium that provides protection for life as\n\na paid-up policy. Single premium funding provides for the lowest total premium and fastest build-up of cash value.\n\n\u25e6 For example, John, a 30-year-old non-smoker, buys a $100,000 whole life policy for one single\n\n\u2022 premium of $70,000.\n\n\u2022 Level (fixed) premium funding: The policyowner pays more in the early years for protection to help",

The shorter the premium-paying period, the higher the periodic premiums.\n\n\u25e6 For example, John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for 10 (annual) level premiums\n\n\u2022 of $8,000 each ($80,000 total premiums); or John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for 840 level premiums (monthly for 70 years) of $105 each ($88,200 total).\n\n\u2022 Modified premium funding is characterized by an initial premium that\u2019s lower than it should be\n\nduring an introductory period (typically the first three to five years). After this time, the premium will increase to an amount that\u2019s greater than what the initial level premium would have been and then remains level or constant for the life of the policy.\n\n\u25e6 For example, John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for 36 initial fixed premiums\n\n\u2022 (monthly for three years) of $50 each ($1,800 total introductory) and then an additional 804 fixed premiums (monthly for 67 years) of $110 each ($88,440 total remainder). ($1,800 introductory + $88,440 for reminder = $90,240 total).\n\n\u2022 Graded premium funding is a contract that\u2019s characterized (like modified) by a lower premium in\n\nthe early years of the contract. However, premiums increase annually for the initial period. Then, it increases to an amount that\u2019s higher than what the initial level premium would have been, but thereafter remains level or constant for the life of the policy.\n\n\u25e6 For example, John can buy that same $100,000 whole life policy for monthly payments of $20 for\n\n\u2022 year 1, monthly payments of $40 for year 2, monthly payments of $50 for year 3, monthly payments of $75 for year 4 ($2,220 total introductory), and then an additional 792 fixed premiums (monthly for 66 years) of $120 each month ($95,040 total remainder). ($2,220 introductory + $95,040 for reminder = $97,260 total).\n\n\u2022 Flexible premium funding allows the policyowner to adjust the premiums throughout the life of the\n\ncontract.\n\n\u2022 Minimum deposit financing allows the policyowner to use policy loans to pay premiums that are due\n\neach year. The policyowner only pays the difference between the premium due and the amount borrowed (plus interest on the policy loan). Depending on the type of policy, a policyowner may be able to use the policy\u2019s cash value and dividends to pay the premium.\n\nCOMPARING LIFE INSURANCE POLICY COSTS\n\n\u2022 The cost of life insurance is largely dependent on an individual\u2019s specific circumstances and\n\nrequirements. However, cost estimates are useful so that the consumer can consider every factor when making a buying decision. A lower premium doesn\u2019t automatically equate to a lower-cost policy. To that extent, cost indexes have been developed to aid in the process of measuring an insurance policy\u2019s actual cost.\n\n\u2022 Surrender Cost Index: Uses a complicated calculation formula in which the net cost is averaged\n\nover the number of years during which the policy was in force to arrive at the average cost-per- thousand for a policy that\u2019s surrendered for its cash value at the end of that period.\n\n\u2022 Net Payment Cost Index: Uses the same formula as the Surrender Cost Index, with the exception",

The net payment cost index is useful if a person\u2019s primary concern is the amount of death benefits provided in the policy. It helps compare future costs (e.g., 10 to 20 years) if a person continues to pay premiums and doesn\u2019t take the policy\u2019s cash value.\n\n\u2022 The interest adjusted cost method calculates the cost of life insurance by taking into account the time\n\nvalue of money (i.e., the investment return on sums placed in premium dollars had these sums been invested elsewhere).\n\n\u2022 The traditional net cost method adds a policy\u2019s premiums and subtracts both dividends (if any) and\n\ncash value.\n\nPOLICY PROCEEDS\n\n\u2022 Living Benefits: A living benefit is the option to use some of the future death benefit proceeds before\n\ndeath.\n\n\u2022 Cash Value: The cash (equity) that accumulates and may be borrowed against, used as collateral,\n\nutilized as supplemental retirement income, or may be withdrawn for emergencies or other situations in which cash is needed.\n\n\u2022 Accelerated Benefit: Allows a person who\u2019s be certified by a physician as terminally ill to access the\n\ndeath benefit. To be considered terminally ill, a physician must certify that the person has a condition or illness that will result in death within two years. After the certification, the insurance company now knows that it will soon be required to pay out the benefit. As a result, it will allow the person to use some of the proceeds now and deduct it from what\u2019s paid to the beneficiary later.\n\n\u2022 Viatical Settlement: Allows a person who has a terminal illness to sell his existing life insurance\n\npolicy to a third party for a percentage of the death benefit. The new owner continues to make the premium payments and will eventually collect the full death benefit. The original policyowner is referred to as the viator, while the new third-party owner is referred to as the viatical or viatee.\n\n\u2022 Life Settlement: A life settlement is the sale of an existing life insurance policy to a third party for\n\nmore than its cash surrender value, but less than its net death benefit. An insured is not required to have a terminal illness to participate in a life settlement.\n\n\u2022 Policy Dividends: Dividends are a refund of a part of the premium under a mutual insurer\u2019s\n\nparticipating policy. The policyowner may use dividends for cash payments, to pay the insurance premium, to purchase additional paid-up whole life insurance, to purchase one-year term insurance, or as an investment to accumulate interest. Although not directly tied to the policy proceeds, dividends are still considered a living benefit.\n\n\u2022 Death Benefit Settlement Options: Although customarily selected by the beneficiary, the\n\npolicyowner may select a settlement option at the time of the application and may change the option at any time during the insured\u2019s life. If selected by the policyowner, the settlement option cannot be changed by the beneficiary. Death benefit settlement options include:\n\n\u25e6 Lump-Sum: Death benefit is paid in a single payment, minus any outstanding policy loan\n\n\u2022 balances and overdue premiums. The lump-sum option is considered the automatic (or \u201cdefault\u201d) option for most life insurance contracts.\n\n\u25e6 Interest Only: The insurance company holds the death benefit for a period and pays only the\n\n\u2022 interest earned to beneficiaries.\n\n\u2022 A minimum rate of interest is guaranteed, and the interest must be paid at least annually.\n\n\u25e6 Fixed Period (Period Certain): The insurer pays proceeds (including interest and principal) in\n\n\u2022 minimum guaranteed dollar payments over a specified number of years.\n\n\u25e6 Fixed Amount: The insurer pays a fixed death benefit in specified installment amounts until the\n\n\u2022 proceeds are exhausted. The larger the installment payment, the shorter the payout period.\n\n\u25e6 Life Income: This provides the beneficiary with an income that she cannot outlive. Installment\n\n\u2022 payments are guaranteed for as long as the recipient lives. The amount of each installment is based on the recipient\u2019s life expectancy and the principal benefit.\n\n\u25e6 Joint and Survivor: Benefits will be paid on a life-long basis to two or more people.

A\n\nbeneficiary can be either specific (a person who\u2019s identified by name and relationship) or a class designation (a group of individuals, such as the children of the insured). If no beneficiary is named or if all beneficiaries die before the insured dies, the death benefit will go to the insured\u2019s estate. The policyowner is the ultimate decision-maker. However, in the underwriting process, the underwriter may consider the issue of insurable interest. Examples of who can be beneficiaries include:\n\n\u25e6 Individuals\n\n\u25e6 Businesses\n\n\u25e6 Trust\n\n\u25e6 Estates\n\n\u25e6 Charities\n\n\u25e6 Minors\n\n\u25e6 Class\n\nDISTRIBUTION BY ORDER OF SUCCESSION\n\n\u2022 Primary: The first in line to receive death benefit proceeds.\n\n\u2022 Secondary (contingent): The second in line to receive death benefit proceeds if the primary\n\nbeneficiary dies first.\n\n\u2022 Tertiary: The third in line to receive death benefit proceeds. If one is not named, the death benefit\n\nwill go to the insured\u2019s estate.\n\n\u2022 Distribution by Descent\n\n\u25e6 Per Stirpes (meaning by the bloodline): If a beneficiary dies before the insured, benefits from\n\n\u2022 that policy will be paid to that beneficiary\u2019s heirs.\n\n\u25e6 Per capita (meaning by the head): Evenly distributes benefits among all named living\n\n\u2022 beneficiaries.\n\nCHANGING A BENEFICIARY\n\n\u2022 Revocable Beneficiary: The policyowner may change the beneficiary at any time without notifying\n\nor obtaining the beneficiary\u2019s permission.\n\n\u2022 Irrevocable Beneficiary: The beneficiary cannot be changed without the beneficiary\u2019s written\n\nconsent. The irrevocable beneficiary has a vested interest in the policy. Therefore, the policyowner cannot exercise certain rights (e.g., taking out a policy loan) without the beneficiary\u2019s consent.\n\nSPECIAL SITUATIONS\n\n\u2022 Uniform Simultaneous Death Act: If the insured and the primary beneficiary die at approximately\n\nthe same time as the result of a common accident with no clear evidence as to who died first, the act will assume that the primary beneficiary died first. This allows the death benefit proceeds to be paid to the contingent beneficiary(ies).\n\n\u2022 Common Disaster Provision: With this provision, a policyowner can be certain that if both the\n\ninsured and the primary beneficiary die within a short period, the death benefits will be paid to the contingent beneficiary.\n\n\u2022 Spendthrift Clause: Prevents the deceased\u2019s creditors from obtaining the death benefit and prevents a\n\nbeneficiary from recklessly spending benefits by requiring the benefits to be paid in fixed amounts or installments over a certain period.\n\n\u2022 The facility of payment allows the insurance company to pay all or a part of the proceeds to a person\n\nwho\u2019s not named in the policy, but has a valid right. Facility of payment is often done on behalf of a minor or when the named beneficiary is deceased.\n\nTAX CONSEQUENCES OF LIFE INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 Premiums that are paid on individual life insurance policies and premiums that are paid for life\n\ninsurance used for business purposes (the company\u2019s benefit) are generally not tax-deductible. However, exceptions allow premiums to be tax-deductible for:\n\n\u25e6 Premiums on an insurance policy to benefit a charity\n\n\u25e6 Premiums on an insurance policy to benefit an ex-spouse as court-ordered alimony\n\n\u2022 Employer-paid premiums that are used to fund group insurance for the benefit of employees are tax-\n\ndeductible for the employer.\n\n\u2022 Living benefits can have tax implications depending on the situation.\n\n\u2022 Cash Value: For policies that are not surrendered, the cash value grows on a tax-free basis. If the\n\npolicy is surrendered for its cash value, the portion that exceeds the premiums paid is taxable. As long as the cash value remains in the policy, taxes will never be imposed on any portion, not even the amount that exceeds the cost basis.\n\n\u2022 According to the IRS, proceeds from a policy loan don\u2019t count as taxable income. However, if a\n\npolicy is surrendered or lapses, the IRS is notified of the taxable event and taxes may be required.",

However, if the policyowner chooses to leave the dividends with the\n\ninsurance company as an investment, any interest that accumulates will be subject ordinary income tax.\n\n\u2022 The transfer for value rule applies when a life insurance policy is sold to another party before the\n\ninsured\u2019s death. For this reason, most states require a viatical settlement company or life settlement company to inform the client that the proceeds could be taxable in certain situations and it should be recommended that they consult with a tax advisor.\n\n\u2022 1035 Exchange: When an existing life insurance policy is assigned to another insurer for a new\n\ncontract, the transaction may be treated for tax purposes as a Section 1035 exchange. Policy exchanges that qualify as 1035 exchanges are not taxable. A Section 1035 exchange enables the postponement of tax consequences.\n\n\u2022 Under the Economic Benefit Doctrine, any benefit granted to an individual that has an economic or\n\nfinancial value must be included as compensation for income tax purposes in the year in which the benefit is granted. Individual life insurance generally avoids this doctrine since premature death can cause a substantial risk to a surviving family.\n\n\u2022 Life insurance proceeds that are paid to a beneficiary as a lump-sum are generally received tax-free.\n\nAdditionally, proceeds pass directly to the beneficiary and are not subject to attachment by the insured\u2019s creditors.\n\n\u2022 If death benefits are paid to a beneficiary in installments (as opposed to as a lump-sum), the principal\n\nis received tax-free and any interest received is taxable.\n\n\u2022 Another tax cost that\u2019s typically associated with death is the federal estate tax (although most\n\nrelatively simple estates don\u2019t require the filing of an estate tax return).",

The larger the policy, the more comprehensive and diligent the underwriting process.\n\n\u2022 The most common sources of underwriting information include:\n\n\u25e6 The application\n\n\u25e6 The medical report\n\n\u25e6 Attending physician\u2019s statement\n\n\u25e6 The Medical Information Bureau\n\n\u25e6 Special questionnaires\n\n\u25e6 Inspection reports\n\n\u25e6 Credit reports\n\n\u2022 Application: The application is the starting point and primary source of information that\u2019s used by an\n\ninsurance company in the risk selection. Although applications differ from company to company, they all have the same general components. Insurable interest must exist between the policyowner and insured at the time that the application is made (not at the time of death/loss).\n\n\u2022 Insurable interest exists when the death of the insured would have a clear financial impact on the\n\npolicyowner.\n\n\u2022 An application has the following three parts:\n\n\u25e6 Part I of the application includes:\n\n\u2022 \u2022 General information (e.g., age, date of birth, gender, address, marital status, occupation)\n\n\u2022 Details about the requested insurance coverage (e.g., type of policy, amount of insurance, name and relationship of the beneficiary, other insurance the proposed insured owns)\n\n\u2022 Other information personal information\n\n\u25e6 Tobacco use\n\n\u25e6 Hazardous hobby\n\n\u25e6 Foreign travel\n\n\u25e6 Aviation activity\n\n\u25e6 Military service\n\n\u25e6 Part II of the application includes:\n\n\u2022 Medical information and health history\n\n\u2022 A medical section which must be completed in its entirety for every application (depending on\n\n\u2022 the proposed policy, this section may be all that\u2019s required in the way of medical information)\n\n\u2022 The disclosure that the individual to be insured may be required to take a medical exam or\n\n\u2022 provide a blood test or urine specimen\n\n\u25e6 Part III of the application includes:\n\n\u2022 The agent\u2019s report (statement) which contains the agent\u2019s observations of the applicant\n\n\u2022 The applicant\u2019s financial condition, character, background, the purpose of sale, and how\n\n\u2022 long the agent has known the applicant.\n\n\u2022 (Because the agent represents the insurance company\u2019s interests, the agent is expected to complete this part of the application thoroughly and truthfully.)\n\n\u2022 Policies below a certain face amount (e.g., $50,000, or even $100,000) will not require additional\n\nmedical information, other than what\u2019s provided by the application. However, they require a medical report for further information.\n\n\u2022 Credit Reports: An applicant\u2019s credit history may be used for underwriting and determines the\n\nlikelihood of the premium payments being made. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires the applicant to be notified in writing if a credit report will be used. The applicant must also be notified if the premium is increased because of a credit rating.\n\n\u2022 Warranty: Warranties are statements that are guaranteed to be literally true. A warranty that\u2019s not\n\nliterally true in every detail, even if it\u2019s made in error, is sufficient to render a policy void.\n\n\u2022 Representations include statements made by the applicant that are substantially true to the best of his\n\nknowledge but are not warranted as exact in every detail.\n\n\u2022 Medical Report: A medical report is often used for underwriting policies with higher face amounts. If\n\nthe medical section\u2019s information warrants further investigation into the applicant\u2019s medical conditions, the underwriter may need an attending physician\u2019s statement (APS).\n\n\u2022 Inspection Reports: This report provides information about the applicant\u2019s character, lifestyle, and",

However, company rules vary as to the sizes of policies that require a report by an outside agency. When an investigative consumer report is used in connection with an insurance application, the applicant has the right to receive a copy of the report.\n\n\u2022 Companies are allowed to obtain inspection reports under The Fair Credit Reporting Act. The FCRA\n\nregulates how credit information is collected and used to protect the rights of the consumers for whom an inspection or credit report has been requested. It established procedures for the collection and disclosure of information obtained on a consumer through investigation and credit reports.\n\n\u2022 If an insurance company requests a credit report, the consumer must be notified in writing.

Information from the MIB is used by life and health insurance companies to help avoid adverse selection by applicants. It detects misrepresentations, helps identify fraudulent information, and controls the cost of insurance. Information received or released from the Medical Information Bureau about a proposed insured may be released to the proposed insured\u2019s physician.

The purpose of the act is to detect and deter terrorism. A life insurance policy can be cash-surrendered, which can be an attractive money- laundering vehicle because it allows criminals or terrorists to put dirty money in and take clean money out in the form of an insurance company check.\n\n\u2022 Special Questionnaires: These are used for applicants who are involved in particular activities, such\n\nas aviation, military service, or hazardous occupations or hobbies. The questionnaire provides details regarding the amount of time the applicant spends on these activities.\n\n\u2022 Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA): The FCRA regulates the amount of credit information\n\ncan be collected and protects the rights of consumers for whom an inspection or credit report has been requested. Information regarding an individual\u2019s credit standing and general reputation is contained in a consumer report. The FCRA established procedures for the collection and disclosure of information obtained on consumers through investigation and credit reports. If an insurance company requests a credit report, the consumer must be notified of this fact in writing. The applicant has the right to receive a copy of the report when an investigative consumer report is used in connection with an insurance application.\n\n\u2022 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) is a privacy rule that provides\n\nfederal protections for an individual\u2019s health information. Furthermore, HIPAA gives patients a variety of rights concerning individually identifiable health information.

This evaluation is referred to as risk classification.\n\n\u2022 Once all the information about a given applicant has been reviewed, the underwriter will utilize\n\nseveral different types of information in determining the insurability of the individual and the risk that the applicant poses to the insurer. This evaluation is known as risk classification. The following rating classification system is used to categorize the favorability of a given risk:\n\n\u2022 Preferred: This classification is characterized by low risk and low premiums. Some of the following\n\nmay result in a policy being issued with a preferred insurance premium:\n\n\u25e6 The applicant doesn\u2019t smoke or drink.\n\n\u25e6 The applicant has good personal/family health history.\n\n\u2022 Standard: This classification is characterized by average risk with no extra ratings or restrictions. The\n\npolicies will have standard terms and rates.\n\n\u2022 Substandard: This classification is characterized by high risk and rated up (higher) premiums due to\n\nchronic conditions, insulin diabetes, or heart disease.\n\n\u2022 Declined: This means the applicant is not insurable because the potential of loss to the insurance\n\ncompany is too high. The applicant has a terminal illness or too many chronic conditions.\n\n\u2022 Field underwriting is completed by an agent. Unlike the insurer, the agent has face-to-face contact\n\nwith the applicant, which can aid the insurer in risk selection. As field underwriters, agents help reduce the chance of adverse selection, assure that the application is filled out completely and correctly, collect the initial premium, and deliver the policy. Other duties include:\n\n\u25e6 Forwarding the application to the insurer in a timely manner\n\n\u25e6 Seeking additional information about the applicant\u2019s medical history (if requested)\n\n\u25e6 Notifying the insurer of any suspected misstatements in the application\n\n\u25e6 Assuring that the application is filled out completely and correctly\n\n\u25e6 Collecting the initial premium\n\n\u2022 In addition, agents have the responsibility and duty to solicit only profitable business. Therefore, an\n\nagent\u2019s solicitation and prospecting efforts should focus on cases that fall within the insurer\u2019s underwriting guidelines and represent profitable business to the insurer.\n\n\u2022 Upon policy delivery, agents must deliver the life insurance buyer\u2019s guide and policy summary to the\n\napplicant. A life insurance producer may also be required to obtain a signature on a good health statement at the time of policy delivery.\n\n\u2022 If an agent realizes that an applicant has made an error on an application, the agent must correct the\n\ninformation and have the applicant initial the changes.\n\n\u2022 An incomplete application will be returned to the agent.\n\n\u2022 The agent can NEVER change the application without the customer present to initial the changes.\n\n\u2022 Buyer\u2019s Guide: This document provides general information about the types of life insurance policies\n\navailable in simple language that can be understood by the average person.

For example, a 75-year-old customer who\u2019s living off of Social Security is not suitable for a single premium deferred annuity because she would be giving up a large sum of cash that she may need to live on and could possibly not live long enough to collect on the annuity.\n\n\u2022 Signatures: The agent and the applicant are both required to sign the application. If the applicant is a\n\nperson other than the proposed insured (except for a minor child), the proposed insured must also sign the application. In most states, having a policyowner (applicant) who\u2019s different from the insured (parent and minor child) is considered third party ownership. For an insurance policy, once a minor reaches the age of 15, he\u2019s eligible to enter into a contract.\n\n\u2022 If an agent fails to deliver a fully completed and accurate application, the insurance company will\n\nreturn the agent\u2019s application.\n\n\u2022 Agents should make every effort to collect the initial premium with each application. However, if the\n\npremium is not collected with the application, the policy will not become valid until it\u2019s collected.\n\n\u2022 Once the initial premium is collected, the agent issues a premium receipt to the applicant.\n\n\u2022 The only time a customer will receive a receipt is if he pays his initial premium at the time of\n\napplication. No receipt will be given at any other time.\n\n\u2022 There are two types of premium receipts which determine when coverage will begin\u2014conditional\n\nreceipts and binding receipts.\n\n\u25e6 Conditional Receipt: The producer issues a conditional receipt to the applicant when the application and premium are collected. The conditional receipt indicates that coverage will be effective once certain conditions are met. If the insurer accepts the coverage as applied for, the coverage will take effect from the application or medical exam date, whichever is later.\n\n\u25e6 Binding Receipt: The binding receipt\u2014also referred to as the temporary insurance agreement\u2014 provides coverage from the date of the application regardless of whether the applicant is insurable. Coverage typically lasts for 30 to 60 days, or until the insurer accepts or declines the coverage. Binding receipts are rarely used in life insurance; instead, they\u2019re often used in auto and homeowners\u2019 insurance. Under a binding receipt, coverage is guaranteed until the insurer formally rejects the application. This may also be described as the insurer being bound to coverage until the application is formally rejected. Even if the proposed insured is ultimately found to be uninsurable, coverage is still guaranteed until rejection of the application.\n\n\u2022 As described under the conditional receipt, coverage is not effective without the collection of the\n\ninitial premium, approval of the application, and followed by policy issuance and delivery. If the initial premium doesn\u2019t accompany the application, the premium must be collected by the agent. In some cases, the insurer requires the agent to collect a good health statement from the insured at the delivery time. If the initial premium is not submitted with the application, the policy effective date is established by the insurer. In this case, it could be the date the policy is issued.\n\n\u2022 Generally, for a policy to be in effect:\n\n\u25e6 The insurer must issue the policy\n\n\u25e6 The insured must submit the initial premiums, and\n\n\u25e6 (If applicable) The insured must sign a statement of continued good health.\n\n\u2022 The effective date is important for two reasons, (1) it identifies when the coverage is effective and (2)\n\nit establishes the date by which future annual premiums must be paid.\n\n\u2022 Backdating: This is the process of predating the application by a certain number of months to",

This process is also referred to as \u201csaving age.\u201d In addition, the next premium is due at the backdated anniversary date.\n\n\u2022 Policy issue occurs when the insurer \u201capproves\u201d the application (i.e., it is \u201cissuing the policy\u201d).\n\n\u2022 The insurance issued contract is sent to the sales agent for delivery to the applicant. The policy is\n\ngenerally NOT sent to the policyowner because the sales agent should personally explain it to the policyowner.\n\n\u2022 Technically a policy could be ISSUED and not be delivered for days or weeks later.\n\n\u2022 Constructive Delivery: Policy delivery may be accomplished without physically delivering the\n\npolicy into the policyowner\u2019s possession.\n\n\u2022 Constructive delivery occurs if the insurance company intentionally relinquishes all control over the\n\npolicy and turns it over to a person who\u2019s acting for the policyowner, including the company\u2019s own agent.

It\u2019s used when the applicant did not submit the initial premium with the application in such cases. Common company practice requires that, before leaving the policy, the agent must collect the premium and obtain a signed statement from the insured which attests to her continued good health. Statements of good health are also used when reinstating a policy.\n\n\u2022 Personal delivery of the policy is a good practice since it allows the producer to explain the coverage\n\nto the insured (e.g., riders, provisions, and options). Personal delivery also builds trust and reinforces the need for the coverage. All of the following acts can be considered means of policy delivery\u2014 mailing the policy to the agent, mailing the policy to the applicant, and the agent personally delivering policy.

      "content": "PRINCIPLES OF GROUP INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 Unlike individual life insurance which is written on a single life, group life insurance is written on more than one life.\n\n\u2022 Group life insurance is typically written for employee-employer groups and is most often written as an annual renewable term policy.\n\n\u2022 An important underwriting principle of group life insurance is that the insurance must cover all or a large percentage of the persons in the group.\n\nCONTRIBUTORY AND NON-CONTRIBUTORY PLANS\n\n\u2022 Contributory \u2013 An employee group plan in which employees share the cost. The insurance company\n\nrequires at least 75% of all employees to participate.\n\n\u2022 Non-Contributory \u2013 An employee group plan in which employees do NOT share in the cost. The\n\ninsurance company requires 100% of all employees to be eligible.\n\nFEATURES OF GROUP INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 Features that separate group insurance from individual insurance include:\n\n\u25e6 With group insurance:\n\n\u2022 \u2022 The individual is not required to provide evidence of insurability since group underwriting is involved.\n\n\u2022 The insureds (employees) are not policyowners and only receive a \u201ccertificate of insurance\u201d to prove that they have coverage.\n\n\u2022 The employer is the policyowner and receives one master contract (policy).\n\n\u25e6 Group insurance has lower overall costs due to lower administrative, operational, and selling\n\n\u2022 expenses associated with group plans.\n\n\u25e6 The master contract allows for the flow of insureds, or the entering and exiting under the policy\n\n\u2022 as members join and leave the group.\n\n\u25e6 Group insurance is typically issued as annually renewable level term insurance, which provides a\n\n\u2022 fixed amount of coverage throughout the term of the contract.\n\n\u2022 Although the employer is the policyowner, the employee still has an \u201cincident of ownership\u201d by\n\nnaming the beneficiary.\n\nELIGIBLE GROUPS\n\n\u2022 Groups must exist for a purpose other than obtaining insurance.\n\n\u2022 Among others, group life insurance can be formed by the following organizations:\n\n\u25e6 Single-employee groups\n\n\u25e6 Multiple-employee groups\n\n\u25e6 Labor unions and trade associations\n\n\u25e6 Credit/debit groups\n\n\u25e6 Fraternal organizations\n\n\u25e6 Trustee groups (established by two or more employers or labor unions)\n\nELIGIBILITY OF GROUP MEMBERS (EMPLOYEES)\n\n\u2022 The employee must be full time and actively working.\n\n\u2022 If the plan is contributory, employees must approve of automatic payroll deduction.\n\n\u2022 A new employee probationary period is typically one to six months.\n\n\u2022 During the enrollment period, an employee has 31 days to sign up. Otherwise, he may need to provide\n\nevidence of insurability.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF RISK\n\n\u2022 Insurers require a minimum number of group members/employees to participate in a group insurance\n\nplan in order to minimize adverse selection.\n\n\u2022 Adverse selection means that the people who are most likely to need life insurance will purchase life\n\ninsurance in greater numbers than those who are in good health.\n\n\u2022 After all necessary information is collected on an applicant, the underwriter will classify the applicant\n\nbased on the degree of risk assumed.\n\n\u2022 The following rating classification system is used to categorize the favorability of a given risk:\n\n\u25e6 Preferred: Low risk and lower premiums\n\n\u25e6 Standard: Average risk with no extra ratings or restrictions\n\n\u25e6 Substandard: High risk (rated up) with higher premiums\n\n\u25e6 Declined: Not insurable - Potential of Loss to Insurance Company is\n\nTOO HIGH\n\n\u2022 Lower risks tend to have lower premiums.\n\n\u2022 If an applicant is too risky, the insurer will decline coverage\n\nHOW BENEFITS ARE DETERMINED\n\n\u2022 Most employers will establish benefit schedules according to the following:\n\n\u25e6 Earnings\n\n\u25e6 Employment position\n\n\u25e6 Flat benefit\n\n\u2022 Conversion to an individual policy: If a member\u2019s coverage is terminated, the member and his\n\ndependents may convert their group coverage to individual whole life coverage without being required to show proof of insurability.\n\n\u2022 Conversion Period: An individual must apply for individual coverage within 31 days after the date of\n\ngroup coverage termination.\n\n\u2022 Under the group policy, an individual is covered during the conversion period.\n\n\u2022 Group Policy Termination: If the master policy is terminated, each individual member who has been\n\ninsured for at least five years is permitted to convert to an individual policy that provides coverage up to the face value of the group policy\n\nGROUP CREDIT LIFE",

      "content": "PURPOSE AND FUNCTION\n\n\u2022 While life insurance protects against the risk of premature death, annuities protect against the risk of living too long and outliving income.\n\n\u2022 Annuities are a way of providing a stream of income for a guaranteed period.\n\n\u2022 Simply stated, an annuity is started with a large sum of money that will be paid out in installments over a preset period or until the money is exhausted.\n\n\u2022 The monthly amount of benefit an annuitant receives is based on factors such as principal amount, rate of interest earned by the annuity, and length of the payout period.\n\n\u2022 The contract owner is the individual who purchases the annuity, pays the premiums, and has rights of ownership.\n\n\u25e6 The owner may be the annuitant, the beneficiary, or neither.\n\n\u2022 During the liquidation phase of an annuity contract, the income benefits that are distributed at regular intervals are normally payable to the annuitant.\n\n\u2022 The beneficiary is the person who receives survivor benefits upon the annuitant\u2019s death.\n\n\u2022 Most annuities have two phases\u2014the accumulation (pay-in) period and the annuity (pay-out) period.\n\n\u2022 The accumulation period may typically continue even after the purchase payments cease.\n\n\u2022 The annuity period is also referred to as the liquidation period, annuitization period, or payout period. This is the time when the money that has accrued during the accumulation period is paid-out in the form of payments to the annuitant\n\nSTRUCTURE AND DESIGN\n\n\u2022 Funding Method: When defining an annuity, (describe how it\u2019s paid for) + (describe how it pays the\n\nannuitant) SINGLE PREMIUM (the annuitant pays once) + DEFERRED (it starts paying the annuitant at least one year later).\n\n\u2022 An annuitant CANNOT make installment payments and get paid immediately.\n\n\u2022 Single Payment = a lump-sum payment\n\n\u2022 Periodic Payments (Flexible Premiums) = installments paid over a period of time\n\nDATE INCOME PAYMENTS BEGIN\n\n\u2022 Immediate Annuities: Purchased with a lump-sum payment, and will start providing income\n\npayments within the first year, typically starting 30 days from the purchase date. Its purpose is to provide for the liquidation of a principal sum.\n\n\u25e6 Commonly used to structure the payment of liability insurance settlements, lottery winnings, and\n\n\u2022 other large sums.\n\n\u25e6 This type of annuity is also referred to as a single premium immediate annuity (SPIA).\n\n\u2022 Deferred Annuities: These start providing income payments after the first year and are typically\n\npurchased with either a single lump-sum payment (single premium deferred annuity) or from monthly payments (flexible premium deferred annuity).\n\n\u25e6 For example, a fixed deferred annuity pays out a fixed amount for life starting at a future date. Interest credited to the cash values of annuities is deferred until distribution. Other characteristics of deferred annuities include:\n\n\u2022 \u2022 When a deferred annuity is canceled during the early contract years, the insurer will generally assess a back-end load (referred to as surrender charge).\n\n\u2022 The \u201cbailout\u201d feature, which may be found in single premium deferred annuity contracts, waives surrender charges when the interest rate falls below a stated level.\n\n\u2022 Before a deferred annuity contract can be terminated for its surrender value, the insurer must first obtain authorization from the owner.\n\n\u2022 The accumulation value of a deferred annuity is equal to the sum of premiums paid, PLUS interest earned, MINUS expenses and withdrawals\n\nPAYOUT OPTIONS\n\n\u2022 Straight Life Income Payout Option: This option pays the annuitant a guaranteed income for her\n\nlifetime. When the annuitant dies, no further payments are made to any person. This offers protection against exhaustion of savings due to longevity.\n\n\u2022 Fixed Amount Option: This option provides the annuitant with a fixed payment until the contract\n\nvalue is exhausted, regardless of when that will be. If the annuitant dies before the contract is depleted, the beneficiary receives the remainder.\n\n\u2022 Cash Refund Payout Option: This option pays a guaranteed income to the annuitant for life. If the\n\nannuitant dies before all the money is exhausted, a lump-sum cash payment of the remaining funds is paid out to the annuitant\u2019s beneficiary.\n\n\u2022 Installment Refund Payout Option: This option pays a guaranteed income to the annuitant for life.",

It designed so that benefit payments will continue for a minimum number of years regardless of when the annuitant dies.\n\n\u25e6 For example, if an annuitant selects a 20-year period certain and dies after 10 years, the\n\n\u2022 beneficiary will receive payments for another 10 years.\n\n\u2022 Joint and Full Survivor Payout Option: This option pays out the annuity to two or more people\n\nuntil the last annuitant dies. If one of them dies, the other will continue to receive the same income payments. There are two additional options made available with a joint and survivor payout:\n\n\u25e6 Joint and Two-Thirds Survivor: Survivor will have payments reduced to two-thirds of the\n\n\u2022 original payment.\n\n\u25e6 Joint and One-Half Survivor: Survivor will have payments reduced to one-half of the original\n\n\u2022 payment.\n\nINVESTMENT CONFIGURATION\n\n\u2022 Annuities can also be defined by their investment configuration, which will determine the amount of\n\nincome the benefits pay. The two types of annuity classifications are fixed and variable.\n\n\u25e6 Fixed Annuities: Provide a guaranteed rate of return. Fixed annuities credit interest at a rate that\u2019s no lower than the contract\u2019s guaranteed rate.\n\n\u25e6 Variable Annuity: Doesn\u2019t provide a guaranteed rate of return because of the investment risk. The cash value is based on the results of these investment funds. A statement must be provided to the owner of the annuity at a minimum of once per year.\n\n\u25e6 Variable annuities can be classified as either immediate or deferred. Insurers that deal with\n\n\u2022 variable annuities are subject to dual regulation by the SEC and the state\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation.\n\n\u2022 Accumulation Units: In a variable annuity, the value of the accumulation units varies depending on\n\nthe value of the securities investment that\u2019s a part of a variable annuity.\n\n\u2022 Annuity Units: When the variable annuity is to be paid out to the annuitant, the accumulation units\n\nare converted into annuity units. These payouts can vary from month to month and will depend on the investment results. Although the number of units doesn\u2019t change, the value of each unit will change. The amount of each variable annuity benefit paid to an annuitant varies according to the market value of the securities in the separate account.\n\n\u2022 Equity Indexed Annuities (EIAs): A type of fixed annuity that offers the potential for a higher return\n\nthan a standard fixed annuity. These EIAs may be tied to the Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 Index or the Composite Stock Price Index.\n\n\u2022 Single-Life Annuities: Characterized by having only one annuitant.\n\n\u2022 Tax-Sheltered Annuities: Limited exclusively for employees of religious, charity, or educational\n\ngroups. These annuities are also referred to as 403(b) plans.\n\n\u25e6 Accumulation payments often come from voluntary salary reductions.\n\n\u25e6 The annuitant may have an individual account contract\n\n\u2022 Income Tax Treatment of Annuity Benefits: Annuity benefit payments consist of principal and",

Interest income must be reported for federal income tax purposes upon receiving distributions or income benefits from the contract.\n\n\u2022 Exclusion Ratio: This is a simple way to determine what portion of each annuity benefit payment is\n\ntaxable: Exclusion ratio = Investment in the contract \u00f7 Expected return.\n\n\u2022 Partial withdrawal: This is when funds are taken from an annuity before age 59 1/2.

Plans must provide participants with the formula being used by the employer for contributions. The contributions may vary on a yearly basis, and contributions and interest are tax-deferred until withdrawal.\n\n\u2022 With pension plans, employers contribute to a plan based on the employee\u2019s compensation and years of service; it\u2019s not based on company profitability or performance.\n\n\u2022 Money purchase plans allow employers to contribute a fixed annual amount, apportioned to each\n\nparticipant, with benefits based on funds in the account upon retirement.\n\n\u2022 Target benefit plans have a target benefit amount.\n\n\u2022 Stock bonus plans are similar to a profit-sharing plan, except that the employer\u2019s contributions are\n\nnot dependent on profits and benefits are distributed in the form of company stock.\n\n\u2022 401(k) plans allow employers to make tax-deductible contributions to the participant, either by\n\nplacing a cash bonus into the employee\u2019s account on a pre-tax basis or the individual taking a reduced salary with the reduction placed pre-tax in the account. The account\u2019s funds are taxable at the time of withdrawal.\n\n\u2022 Tax-sheltered annuities are a particular class of retirement plans that are available to employees of\n\nspecific charitable, educational, or religious organizations.\n\n\u2022 Simplified employee pension (SEP) plans are basically an arrangement whereby an employee\n\n(including a self-employed individual) establishes and maintains an IRA to which the employer contributes. Employer contributions are not included in the employee\u2019s gross income. A primary difference between a SEP and an IRA is that considerably more money can be contributed to an employee\u2019s SEP plan.\n\n\u2022 A Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plan is available to small businesses\n\n(including tax-exempt and government entities) that employ no more than 100 employees who received at least $5,000 in compensation from the employer during the previous year. An employer can choose to make non-elective contributions of 2% of compensation on behalf of each eligible employee. To establish a SIMPLE plan, the employer must not have an existing qualified plan.\n\n\u2022 Keogh (HR-10) plans are for self-employed persons, such as doctors, farmers, lawyers, or other sole-\n\nproprietors. Keoghs may be defined contribution or defined benefit plans. Contributions are tax- deductible, and interest and dividends are tax-deferred.\n\n\u2022 IRAs are established by individuals who have earned income and want to save for retirement.\n\n\u2022 Traditional IRAs allow for an individual to contribute a limited amount of money per year, and the\n\ninterest earned is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Contribution limits are indexed annually and are currently at $6,000 per year or 100%of earned income. Any person who\u2019s 50 or older may contribute an additional $1,000, thereby making her maximum annual contribution $7,000. Some individuals may deduct IRA contributions from their taxes based on their adjusted gross income (AGI), but all withdrawals are taxable as ordinary income. If an individual or spouse is not covered by an employer- sponsored retirement plan, the entire contribution is tax-deductible (regardless of AGI). Withdrawals that are made prior to age 59 1/2 are assessed an additional 10% penalty tax.\n\n\u2022 To avoid penalties, traditional IRA owners must begin to receive payment from their accounts by no\n\nlater than April 1 following the year in which they turn the age of 72.\n\n\u2022 Funds may be withdrawn from an IRA prior to the employee reaching the age of 59 1/2 without being\n\nsubject to the 10% penalty tax (however, the interest is still taxable) for any of the following reasons:\n\n\u25e6 Death, disability, first-time homebuyers (up to $10,000 lifetime), education (no dollar\n\n\u2022 maximum), health insurance premiums (if unemployed), and qualified medical expenses\n\n\u2022 Roth IRAs are designed so that withdrawals are received income tax-free.

This approach determines the total funds available to a family from all sources and subtracts the amount needed to meet their financial objectives. It takes into consideration:\n\n\u25e6 Final expense fund\n\n\u25e6 Housing fund\n\n\u25e6 Education fund\n\n\u25e6 Monthly income\n\n\u25e6 Emergency fund\n\n\u25e6 Income needs (if disabled or ill)\n\n\u25e6 Retirement income\n\n\u25e6 Estate conservation (using life insurance to enable heirs to pay estate taxes)\n\n\u25e6 \u201cNeeds\u201d include ANY PERSON or ENTITY who\u2019s dependent on that person (e.g., child,\n\n\u2022 charity, or pet)\n\n\u2022 The needs approach to personal life insurance planning may involve creating a lump-sum to provide\n\nfor such things as education, retirement, and charitable contributions.\n\n\u2022 The needs approach to personal life insurance planning also includes the creation of an emergency\n\nreserve fund that\u2019s primarily designed to cover the cost of unexpected expenses.\n\nBUSINESS USES OF LIFE INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 Buy-Sell agreements\u2014also referred to as business continuation agreements\u2014are used to assure the\n\nbusiness\u2019s ownership is appropriately transferred upon the death or disability of an owner or partner. Third-party ownership of life insurance policies is widely used in business insurance and estate- planning situations.\n\nBUY-SELL FUNDING FOR SOLE PROPRIETORS\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s a two-step business continuation plan to keep a business running after the proprietor\u2019s death,\n\nwhereby the employee takes over management of the business: 1. Buy-Sell Plan: An attorney drafts a buy-sell plan which indicates the employee\u2019s agreement to\n\n\u2022 purchase the proprietor\u2019s estate and sell the business at a price that has been agreed upon beforehand.\n\n2. Insurance Policy: The employee purchases a life insurance policy on the life of the proprietor.\n\n\u2022 The employee is the policyowner, beneficiary, and pays the premiums. Upon the proprietor\u2019s death, the funds from the policy are used to purchase the business.\n\nBUY-SELL FUNDING FOR PARTNERSHIPS\n\n\u2022 There are two types of buy-sell agreements for partnerships:\n\n1. Cross-purchase plans 2. Entity plans\n\n\u2022 In a cross-purchase plan, each partner buys, pays the premiums, and is the beneficiary of a life\n\ninsurance policy on each of the other partners. The amount of the policy is equivalent to each partner\u2019s share of the business. When one partner dies, each of the other partners receives the death benefit from the life insurance on the deceased partner, which is then used to purchase the business ownership of the deceased partner.\n\n\u2022 In an entity plan, the partnership itself agrees to buy the deceased partner\u2019s share of the business.\n\nEntity plans are best for businesses with several partners. In this case, the business purchases, pays the premiums, and is the beneficiary of life insurance on each partner.\n\nBUY-SELL FUNDING FOR CLOSELY HELD CORPORATIONS\n\n\u2022 Unlike a partnership, a closely held corporation (e.g., an incorporated family business) is legally\n\nseparate from its owners and exists after one or more owners dies. A closely held corporation may purchase either buy-sell plans (i.e., either cross-purchase or entity). The difference is that an entity plan is referred to as a stock redemption plan for closely held corporations.\n\n\u2022 Closely Held Corporation Cross-Purchase Plan\n\n\u25e6 Similar to partnership cross-purchase plans, a closely held corporation cross-purchase plan",

The amount of life insurance is equal to each stockholder\u2019s share of the corporation\u2019s purchase price.

Illness (Sickness or Disease)\n\n\u2022 A sickness (or illness) is best thought of as an internal occurrence that becomes manifest. It may have a sudden onset or develop over time. Accidents\n\n\u2022 An accident is an unintended occurrence resulting in a loss caused by an external source; it\u2019s fixed in time and space. Covered Losses There are five distinct types of losses covered within the broad field of health insurance\u2014medical expense, disability, dental expense, accidental injury, and long-term care.\n\n\u2022 Hospital expenses\n\n\u2022 Surgical expenses\n\n\u2022 Physician expenses\n\n\u2022 Outpatient care\n\n\u2022 \u2022 Policyowners can control the premium cost of a disability income plan by electing a longer\n\nelimination period than may otherwise be desired. Since the benefits that are received from an individually funded disability policy are income-tax-free, policies limit benefits to a percentage of a person\u2019s pre-disability gross earnings.\n\nACCIDENT INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) insurance\u2014a prominent type of accident insurance\u2014 pays a lump-sum benefit amount when an accident results in the insured\u2019s death or dismemberment.\n\nClasses of Health Insurance The \u201cclass\u201d of insurance is another way to categorize the various kinds of health insurance policies, including:\n\n\u2022 Individual versus group contracts\n\n\u2022 Private versus government insurance\n\n\u2022 Limited risk versus comprehensive policies\n\nINDIVIDUAL VERSUS GROUP CONTRACTS\n\n\u2022 Private versus\n\nGOVERNMENT INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 The federal government offers:\n\n\u2022 Medical insurance for seniors through Medicare, and\n\n\u2022 Disability insurance through Social Security (OASDI)\n\n\u2022 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)\u2014also simply referred to as the\n\nAffordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014created state-based and state-administered health insurance exchanges.\n\n\u2022 TRI-CARE is the federal government health plan for active duty and retired service members, as well as their families, and survivors. It has three options: 1. TRI-Care Prime \u2013 which uses military treatment 2. TRI-Care Extra \u2013 which is a PPO 3. TRI-Care Standard \u2013 a fee-for-service option\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE VERSUS LIMITED\n\n\u2022 For example, major medical insurance covers most recognized medical treatments unless specifically excluded.\n\n\u2022 For example, an aviation policy provides benefits for accidental death or dismemberment if death or injury results from an aviation accident during a specified trip.\n\nLimited Insurance Policy Types Limited risk policies cover a specific risk. An example of a limited risk policy is accidental death and dismemberment contracts, which provide benefits only when covered losses occur as a result of accidental bodily injury. State insurance departments require insurance companies to include a \u2018Notice to the Insured\u2019 stating that the contract is a Limited Benefit Policy. A limited risk is different from a special risk. A special risk policy covers unusual hazards that are not normally covered under ordinary accident and health insurance.\n\n\u2022 A limit risk policy covers a common risk in a limited manner. The policy may be \u201climited\u201d in the perils\n\ncovered (accidents or a named disease), the time frame (a specific trip), or the nature of the loss (death or\n\nDISMEMBERMENT). ACCIDENT-ONLY\n\n\u2022 Accidental death and dismemberment insurance pays a lump-sum benefit amount in the event of\n\naccidental death or dismemberment. In general, the insured must die within 90 days of the accident for the\n\nDEATH BENEFIT TO BE PAID.\n\nSPECIFIED (DREAD) DISEASE\n\n\u2022 Dread disease policies provide limited benefits for a specific disease, such as cancer or heart disease.\n\nCRITICAL ILLNESS (SPECIFIED CONDITIONS)\n\n\u2022 Critical illness contracts pay a lump sum to the insured upon the diagnosis and survival of a critical\n\nillness. Benefits can be used to cover non-medical expenses. Covered conditions typically include heart\n\nattacks, strokes, organ transplants, and end stage renal failure.\n\nHOSPITAL INDEMNITY (INCOME)\n\n\u2022 While the insured is confined to a hospital, hospital indemnity insurance policies pay a specified\n\namount on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis directly to the insured (not the hospital). Payment is based\n\nONLY ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS CONFINED IN A HOSPITAL.\n\nCREDIT DISABILITY\n\n\u2022 Credit disability insurance plans protect a lender against the disability of a borrower before the",

The lender or creditor is the policy owner and the beneficiary, while the debtor is the\n\ninsured and typically pays the premiums. This type of contract may also be referred to as decreasing\n\n(TERM) DISABILITY INSURANCE.\n\nBLANKET INSURANCE (E.G., TEAMS AND PASSENGERS)\n\n\u2022 Insurance carriers issue blanket health insurance policies to cover group or association members\n\nwho are exposed to the same risks but at different times. The circumstances are constant, but the group\u2019s\n\ncomposition (individuals within the group) continually changes. As with other group contracts, the group\n\nis the policy owner; however, unlike other group policies, individual enrollment is not required, and\n\nCERTIFICATES OF COVERAGE ARE NOT ISSUED.\n\n\u2022 Prescription drug policies cover the cost of prescription drugs that are not dispensed in a hospital or extended care facility. Most prescription drug policy plans have a co-payment requirement when a prescription is being filled.\n\n\u2022 Some private health care plans cover the costs of audiological tests, hearing aid evaluation, and partial or full coverage for hearing aids.\n\n\u2022 Vision care coverage typically pays the cost of eye examinations by ophthalmologists and optometrists. The cost of contact lenses or eyeglasses is often partially covered.\n\n\u2022 Short-term medical insurance policies typically last for as little as 90 days and may provide coverage for as long as 364 days (just less than one year). Short-term plans are a stripped-down version of medical expense coverage, and consumers have traditionally used these plans as interim coverage to bridge gaps between more robust forms of coverage. In return for a lower premium, insurance buyers must cope with many of the restrictions that are eliminated in major medical policies by the ACA. These policies may be medically underwritten and may exclude pre-existing conditions.\n\nDental Insurance Most dental plans require a review of suggested treatment to ensure it\u2019s reasonable and necessary. This process is defined as a predetermination of benefits, pre-certification, or prior authorization of benefits. All dental plans include limitations, exclusions, and caps on annual benefits. Other common exclusions involve:\n\n\u2022 Cosmetic procedures unless they\u2019re due to an accident\n\n\u2022 Services provided by governmental agencies\n\n\u2022 Treatment that\u2019s covered by Workers\u2019 Compensation\n\n\u2022 Duplicate dentures or the replacement of lost or stolen dentures\n\n\u2022 Oral hygiene instructions or similar training\n\n\u2022 Exotic procedures, such as splinting and restoring occlusion Replacement of prosthetic appliances (e.g., retainers) is excluded for five years after the benefits are paid Dental plans may also include limitations on benefits for dental emergency services that are offered outside the network area.\n\n\u2022 Dental insurance may be covered by a medical expense plan. These integrated plans include a single\n\ndeductible that may be satisfied by either dental or medical expenses. Dental insurance may also be\n\noffered as a standalone plan. When dental coverage is offered as an optional benefit, the plan is\n\nCONSIDERED NON-INTEGRATED.\n\nDental plans may be either scheduled or non-scheduled:\n\n\u2022 Scheduled plans organize coverage into treatment categories, with stated limits for each.\n\n\u2022 Non-scheduled plans pay benefits on a usual, customary, and reasonable basis (UCR).\n\nMost dental plans provide coverage for diagnostic and preventive treatment.",

      "content": "Fee-for-Service\n\n\u2022 PPOs operate on a fee-for-service basis.\n\n\u2022 PPOs often require subscribers to pay a percentage of their medical costs, which is referred to as co- insurance.\n\n\u25e6 PPO co-insurance is a percentage, whereas an HMO\u2019s co-pay is a flat dollar amount.\n\n\u25e6 PPO co-insurance is a cost-sharing mechanism in which the subscriber pays a portion of the \u201cfee\n\n\u2022 for service.\u201d An HMO co-pay primarily covers administrative costs.\n\n\u2022 HMOs have utilization risk because of capitation, whereas PPOs do not.\n\nIN-NETWORK VERSUS OUT OF NETWORK\n\n\u2022 PPOs provide coverage out-of-network coverage for non-emergency care.\n\n\u2022 PPOs reduce out-of-network coverage.\n\n\u2022 PPOs increase co-insurance.\n\n\u2022 Also, out-of-network providers don\u2019t abide by discounted network guidelines.\n\nDIRECT ACCESS TO ANY PROVIDER\n\n\u2022 The traditional PPO model doesn\u2019t require primary care physician referrals to in-network specialists.\n\nPPO INNOVATIONS AND OPTIONS\n\n\u2022 PPOs can include dental care and long-term care in the form of nursing services.\n\nPOINT-OF-SERVICE (POS) PLANS\n\n\u2022 A POS plan combines indemnity (traditional major medical) plan features with those of an HMO.\n\n\u2022 A POS allows subscribers to choose out-of-network as well as in-network providers. In-Network Coverage\n\n\u2022 With in-network coverage, the insured receives care much like an HMO.\n\n\u2022 The insured\u2019s PCP coordinates all care.\n\n\u2022 Subscribers must follow the referral requirements to receive full in-network coverage. Out-of-Network Coverage\n\n\u2022 Insureds who receive out-of-network care pay a higher share of the cost.\n\n\u2022 Subscribers pay a substantial co-insurance percentage.\n\n\u2022 POS plans don\u2019t necessarily base payments on average market prices (usual and customary costs). Instead, they calculate their coverage based on their lower in-network costs. Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs)\n\n\u2022 An EPO is a hybrid of an HMO and a PPO.\n\n\u2022 Like a PPO, an insured doesn\u2019t need a referral to obtain care from an in-network specialist.\n\n\u2022 Like an HMO, an insured is responsible for paying out-of-pocket for care from an out-of-network provider.\n\nGROUP INSURANCE PLANS\n\n\u2022 Group health insurance is a class of policy rather than a provider.\n\n\u2022 Group health insurance is a distinct source of coverage with shared characteristics. The entire class of policies is treated as a distinct provider.\n\nBASIC GROUP PLAN CHARACTERISTICS\n\n\u2022 The nature of the sponsoring group must be acceptable.\n\n\u2022 State laws specify the minimum number of persons to be covered under a group policy.\n\n\u2022 Employers may differentiate the benefits offered according to the common characteristics that distinguish the employee classes (union versus non-union, full-time versus part-time, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Employers cannot discriminate against specific individuals within a particular employee class.\n\nELIGIBLE GROUPS\n\n\u2022 To qualify for group health coverage, the group must be a natural group.\n\n\u2022 The term \u201cnatural group\u201d means that it must have been formed for some reason other than to obtain insurance.\n\n\u2022 Taft-Hartley Trusts are formed as a result of collective bargaining between a labor union and an employer.\n\n\u2022 Employers are prohibited from paying funds directly to a labor union to provide group health insurance to its members.\n\n\u2022 Policy Ownership\n\n\u2022 Insurers issue the policy\u2014referred to as the master contract\u2014to the employer or the other\n\nsponsoring organization.\n\n\u2022 The sponsor is considered the master policy owner.\n\n\u2022 Covered individuals receive a certificate of insurance.\n\n\u2022 Participants also receive an outline or booklet that describes their benefits.\n\n\u2022 Typically, group benefits are more extensive than those provided by individual health insurance\n\npolicies.\n\n\u2022 Group health plans often offer broader coverage, including ancillary programs, higher benefit\n\nmaximums, and lower out-of-pocket costs.\n\nLOWER COST\n\n\u2022 The cost of insuring an individual under a group health plan is lower than an individual policy\u2019s cost\n\nbecause of lower administrative and selling expenses.\n\nCONSOLIDATED ADMINISTRATION\n\n\u2022 Administrative costs are lower because the carrier insures multiple individuals under one contract.\n\n\u2022 Also, the policy owner (employer or another sponsor) helps provide services to the enrolled\n\nparticipants.\n\nPREDETERMINED BENEFITS\n\n\u2022 The sponsor predetermines benefits for individual insureds, which simplifies underwriting and\n\nadministrative costs.\n\nINCREASED PERSISTENCY\n\n\u2022 When a person drops an individual insurance policy, the contract is lost.\n\n\u2022 When an individual participant leaves a group, the master contract remains in force.\n\nUNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT",

PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n\u2022 Minimum participation requirements from among eligible classes of enrollees help insurers to avoid\n\nadverse selection.\n\n\u2022 If a group\u2019s participation percentage drops, the insurer may terminate the plan.\n\nCONTRIBUTORY PLANS\n\n\u2022 If employees pay a portion of the group insurance premium, the plan is a contributory plan.\n\n\u2022 Contributory group health plans often require participation by 75% of eligible members.\n\nNON-CONTRIBUTORY PLANS\n\n\u2022 If the employer pays the entire premium, the plan is a non-contributory plan.\n\n\u2022 Most non-contributory group health plans require 100% participation by eligible members.\n\nSTATE VARIATIONS\n\n\u2022 Standard percentages for participation are benchmarks, not the product of law. Requirements may\n\nvary with each state.\n\nAlternative Forms of Group Insurance Multiple Employer Trusts (METs)\n\n\u2022 The Multiple Employer Trust (MET) is a method of marketing group benefits to employers that have few employees.\n\n\u2022 A MET combines multiple employers (10 or more) into a single pool for the purpose of providing group insurance.\n\n\u2022 A MET holds the master contract rather than the participating employers.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u25e6 An employer that wants to obtain coverage for employees from a Multiple Employer Trust must first\n\nbecome a member.\n\n\u2022 A MET typically funds benefits with an insurance contract that\u2019s purchased from an insurance\n\ncompany.\n\n\u2022 A MET may be insured and administered by a third-party administrator (TPA).\n\n\u2022 These trusts are also referred to as 501(c)(9) trusts after the relevant section of the Internal Revenue\n\nCode.\n\n\u2022 Partially self-funded trusts limit potential losses by purchasing stop-loss insurance.\n\n\u2022 State regulations pertaining to METs vary.\n\nMULTIPLE EMPLOYER WELFARE ARRANGEMENTS (MEWA)\n\n\u2022 A Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement is similar to a MET; in fact, the terms are often used\n\ninterchangeably.\n\n\u2022 MEWAs are tax-exempt entities.\n\n\u2022 MEWAs consist of two or more employers that have joined to provide affordable health benefits for\n\ntheir employees on a self-funded (or self-insured) basis.\n\n\u2022 Employees who are covered by a MEWA are required by law to have an employment-related common\n\nbond.\n\n\u2022 MEWAs are risk retention instruments. The law treats them as \u201cemployee welfare benefit plans\u201d and\n\nsubjects them to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) mandates, which often supersede state insurance department regulations.\n\nSELF-INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 \u201cSelf-insurance\u201d does NOT mean \u201cno insurance.\u201d",

This is based on the Constitutional Doctrine of Interstate Comity.\n\n\u2022 Having a single state of jurisdiction means that the group insurance contract must only conform to that one state\u2019s laws and regulations.\n\n\u2022 The producer will generally deliver a group health insurance policy to the location of the employer.\n\n\u2022 Federal regulatory requirements apply regardless of state lines. The Termination of a\n\nGROUP PLAN\n\n\u2022 An employer or fiduciary must provide a 45-day notice of termination of the plan to all those covered.\n\n\u2022 If a group health plan terminates, employees may convert to an individual health plan without evidence of insurability. Impact of Termination on\n\nCOVERED INDIVIDUALS\n\n\u2022 Unless the law states otherwise, coverage for an employee and his dependents can terminate on the date employment is terminated.\n\n\u2022 Termination may occur in other circumstances, including:\n\n\u25e6 An employee ceases to be eligible (regardless of the reason)\n\n\u25e6 The master policy is surrendered or canceled\n\n\u25e6 An employee fails to make a required contribution\n\n\u25e6 The end of a continuation of benefits period for employees and dependents that follows the\n\n\u2022 termination of a person\u2019s employment\n\n\u2022 Coverage under group plans may be continued for employees and dependents even after employment\n\nends due to COBRA or other applicable laws or policy provisions.\n\n\u2022 Continuation and Conversion\n\nEXTENSION OF BENEFITS\n\n\u2022 An extension of benefits covers open, existing claims when an employee or dependent is sick or disabled at the time the insured\u2019s group membership ends.\n\n\u2022 This extension doesn\u2019t cover new claims.\n\n\u2022 Disability benefits will continue until the disability ends.\n\n\u2022 Medical insurance offers coverage that continues to pay for active claims at the time of termination, including hospitalization or medical care, but generally not for more than 12 months.",

Remember, collecting two or more benefits is a prohibited act.\n\n\u2022 The purpose of a short-term disability (STD) policy is to quickly replace a percentage of the insured\u2019s\n\nincome while she recovers from a temporary injury or illness that prevents her from working but is less serious in nature.\n\n\u25e6 Common uses included surgery and childbirth.\n\n\u2022 Long-term disability (LTD) plans provide longer benefit periods and are typically reserved for an injury\n\nor illness that\u2019s more serious in nature.\n\nQUALIFYING FOR BENEFITS\n\n\u2022 Disability income policies primarily define \u201cdisability\u201d as the inability to perform tasks or earn an income.\n\n\u2022 Disability income policies also include \u201cmedical definitions\u201d of disability based on a direct physical injury rather than any consequential income loss.\n\n\u2022 Some contracts cover losses at work, while others do NOT.\n\n\u2022 Being under the care of a physician is required regardless of whether the contract defines disability based on a person\u2019s:\n\n\u25e6 Loss of income, or\n\n\u25e6 Inability to perform the duties of his employment\n\nTOTAL DISABILITY\n\n\u2022 Disability insurance policies define the term \u201cdisability\u201d as either a loss of income, a loss of a person\u2019s ability to work at a job, or both.\n\nINABILITY TO PERFORM DUTIES\n\n\u2022 Disability income policies generally define disability as a person\u2019s \u201cinability to perform the material and substantial duties\u201d of one or more occupations.\n\n\u2022 The phrase \u201cmaterial duties\u201d refers to the actual tasks or activities that a person performs while doing her job.\n\n\u2022 The term \u201csubstantial duties\u201d can also be referred to as \u201ckey duties\u201d or \u201cessential capabilities.\u201d\n\nANY OCCUPATION\n\n\u2022 The \u201cany occupation\u201d definition of disability requires an insured to be unable to perform \u201cthe material and substantial duties\u201d of:\n\n\u25e6 Her own occupation, or\n\n\u25e6 Any occupation for which she\u2019s reasonably suited by education, training, or experience.\n\nOWN OCCUPATION\n\n\u2022 The own occupation definition of disability requires the insured to be unable to perform \u201cthe material and substantial duties of her own occupation.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This definition is less restrictive than the \u201cany occupation\u201d definition.\n\n\u2022 Such policies are more expensive and often reserved for certain professions.",

The amount of\n\nincome lost defines the degree of disability. The insured receives a percentage of the total disability benefit. For example: If Frances suffers a disability that results in a 40% loss of income, she will have a residual disability rating of 40%. Frances\u2019s policy will pay her 40% of her policy\u2019s total disability benefit.\n\n\u2022 The recurrent disability clause applies when the insured returns to work after a disability but suffers a\n\nrelapse.\n\n\u2022 Under the terms of the recurrent disability provision, the relapse is considered part of the original\n\ndisability if it occurs within six months after the insured returns to work. As such, the following conditions apply:\n\n\u25e6 No new elimination period (benefits begin immediately)\n\n\u25e6 No new benefit period (If the insured has a five-year benefit period and has already received six\n\n\u2022 months of benefits before returning to work, he now has 4.5 years remaining.)\n\n\u2022 Presumptive disability identifies certain conditions that automatically qualify an insured for the total\n\nbenefit.\n\n\u2022 Losses that qualify as presumptive disabilities include the following:\n\n\u25e6 Double dismemberments\n\n\u25e6 Total and permanent loss of sight\n\n\u25e6 Total and permanent loss of hearing\n\n\u25e6 Total and permanent loss of speech\n\nCONCURRENT DISABILITY\n\n\u2022 When disabling events occur in tandem and result in a single period of disability, the condition is referred to as a concurrent disability.\n\nDELAYED DISABILITY\n\n\u2022 In some cases, total disability doesn\u2019t occur immediately after an accident.\n\n\u2022 Most policies cover total disability claims that manifest some time (e.g., 20, 30, 60, or 90 days) after the occurrence that caused them.\n\n\u2022 The amount of time allowed for a delay between the cause and resulting disability is referred to as delayed disability.\n\nCONFINING VERSUS NON-CONFINING DISABILITY\n\n\u2022 Confined disability requires the insured to remain indoors (at home or in the hospital).\n\n\u2022 Non-confined disability means that an insured is not required to remain indoors.\n\n\u2022 Some disability income policies don\u2019t cover losses arising out of the occupation of the insured.\n\n\u2022 This type of disability income contract is referred to as non-occupational coverage.\n\n\u2022 If the policy pays a monthly income in addition to any benefits received by Workers\u2019 Compensation or\n\nother social insurance plans, it provides occupational coverage.\n\n\u2022 Credit disability guarantees the payment of loan installments if the insured debtor becomes disabled.\n\n\u2022 Credit disability contracts may also be referred to as \u201cdecreasing term disability policies.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The policy pays the creditor, not the debtor.\n\n\u2022 Once the debt is paid off, the policy terminates.\n\n\u2022 There are two types of disability benefits found in life insurance:\n\n\u25e6 The waiver of premium rider, which waives the cost of coverage while the insured is disabled.\n\n\u25e6 The disability income rider converts 1% of the policy\u2019s face amount into a disability benefit.\n\nGOVERNMENT (SOCIAL) DISABILITY INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 Social Security provides disability benefits that are funded by payroll taxes.",

For example, if an applicant\u2019s gross earned income is $3,000 per month, an insurer will allow him to buy a policy with a monthly benefit of up to $1,800.\n\n\u2022 Percent-of-Earnings Approach This approach defines the benefit as a fixed percentage of the\n\ninsured\u2019s pre-disability earnings.\n\n\u2022 This approach is primarily used in group insurance.\n\n\u2022 If the insured\u2019s income increases, the benefit also increases to maintain the percentage.\n\n\u2022 Flat Amount Approach Individual disability policies use the flat amount method, which defines\n\nbenefits as a specific dollar amount.\n\n\u2022 It remains fixed despite changes in income unless the insured has purchased riders allowing him to\n\nincrease his coverage.\n\n\u2022 When calculating a disability claim, we must account for the elimination period.",

Also, their income potential is much higher than their potential benefits.\n\n\u2022 Other white-collar and gray-collar occupations are considered riskier, especially since the incentive to return to work is not as great.\n\n\u2022 Many blue-collar occupations have a higher incidence of physical injury and the highest morbidity rates. In such cases, the insurer will restrict policy terms and limit the benefit period\u2019s length to either two or five years.\n\n\u2022 This provision allows the insurance carrier to automatically change the premium or benefit if the insured\n\nhas not informed the insurer of a change in risk.\n\n\u2022 If the insured\u2019s new occupation is riskier, the benefit decreases.\n\n\u2022 If the insured\u2019s new occupation is less risky, the premium decreases.\n\n\u2022 The relation of earnings to insurance limits the total amount of benefits paid to the amount of pre-\n\ndisability income, even if the available insurance from multiple policies is greater than the income lost.\n\n\u2022 If the available insurance that covers a loss is greater than the loss itself, each policy\u2019s benefit is reduced\n\non a pro-rata basis.\n\n\u2022 This type of rider is also referred to as an exclusion rider or waiver for impairments.\n\n\u2022 Insurers use this rider to permanently exclude certain losses if the risk is too high or too uncertain.\n\n\u2022 It allows insurers to cover most risks for an applicant while still charging a standard premium.\n\n\u2022 The rehabilitation benefit encourages individuals to actively participate in their recovery.\n\n\u2022 The rehabilitation benefit facilitates vocational training to prepare insureds for a new occupation.\n\n\u2022 The rehabilitation benefit provision requires the insurer to pay the approved cost of a rehabilitation\n\nprogram as long as the insured remains disabled and active in the program.\n\n\u2022 The non-disabling injury benefit pays up to a specified amount if the insured suffers an injury and no\n\nother claim is filed.\n\n\u2022 Disability insurance policies are either non-cancelable and guaranteed renewable or guaranteed\n\nrenewable.\n\n\u2022 Neither type of policy can be canceled or non-renewed by an insurer unless the insured fails to pay his\n\npremium.\n\n\u2022 If a policy is non-cancelable, the insurer guarantees the premium rate for the contract\u2019s life as it existed\n\nwhen the insurer issued the policy.\n\n\u2022 If the policy is guaranteed renewable, the insurance carrier has the right to raise rates if the cost of\n\ndisability claims exceeds expectations.\n\n\u2022 The law prohibits an insurance company from raising policy premiums on a particular individual.\n\n\u2022 A company may raise rates on an entire class of policies. This is referred to as raising rates on a \u201cclass\u201d\n\nbasis because it\u2019s based on the entire pool of affected contracts.\n\n\u2022 Guaranteed renewable policies are more common, especially for classes of employment with higher\n\nlevels of morbidity risk.\n\n\u2022 Disability income policies typically require the insured to be actively working for a stated number of\n\nhours per week if coverage extends past the age of 65.\n\n\u2022 The more common exclusions in a disability income policy include:\n\n\u25e6 War (declared or undeclared)\n\n\u25e6 Intentionally self-inflicted injuries\n\n\u25e6 Non-commercial aviation\n\n\u25e6 Military service\n\n\u25e6 All illegal occupations",

Instead, most group disability plans require new participants to fulfill a minimum required length of service before becoming eligible for coverage.\n\n\u2022 Group insurance policies have an elimination period.\n\n\u2022 For example, let\u2019s assume that an employer allows employees two weeks of sick leave per year, a six- month short-term disability plan, and long-term disability insurance.

The\n\ncompany is the beneficiary of each policy and uses the funds to buy out the disabled partner or shareholder.\n\n\u2022 Unlike typical disability income insurance contracts, disability buy-out policies contain a provision that\n\nallows the insurer to pay a lump-sum benefit.\n\n\u2022 Disability buy-sell policies also have lengthy elimination periods, often as long as two years.\n\n\u2022 Key-person disability insurance indemnifies the business for a key person\u2019s lost services.\n\n\u2022 This type of coverage pays a monthly benefit or lump sum if an essential person is disabled.\n\n\u2022 A key person could be a partner, stockholder, or key employee.\n\n\u2022 The key person\u2019s economic value to the business is the potential loss of business income plus the\n\nexpense of hiring and training a replacement.\n\n\u2022 Generally, the policy\u2019s elimination period will be from 30 to 90 days, and the benefit period will be from\n\none or two years.\n\n\u2022 The business is the owner and premium payor of the policy.\n\nTAXATION OF DISABILITY INSURANCE POLICIES\n\n\u2022 When it comes to disability insurance, the IRS generally taxes the money only once\u2014either when the premiums are paid in or when the benefits are taken out.\n\n\u2022 The taxation of social insurance disability benefits depends on the program and the income of the recipient.\n\n\u2022 Social Security Insurance benefits are partially taxed after one\u2019s total income reaches $25,000 for individuals and $32,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n\n\u2022 In general, workers\u2019 compensation benefits are not subject to state or federal income tax.\n\n\u2022 Premiums are not deductible. The IRS counts premiums as part of taxable income and captures a percentage as income tax.\n\n\u2022 Benefits are not taxable. Because the IRS collects income tax on money going into the policy, the insured receives benefits from the policy, free of income tax.\n\n\u2022 The premiums paid by employers are tax-deductible as legitimate business expenses.\n\n\u2022 The group policy benefits the employees, not the employer or the business.\n\n\u2022 The taxation of employee premium dollars and benefits depends on several sets of circumstances (described below).\n\n\u2022 If the employer pays a participating worker\u2019s disability insurance premium, the benefits are taxable.\n\n\u2022 The employer deducts the premium from taxable income; therefore, the IRS will tax the money coming\n\nout of the policy in the form of benefits.\n\n\u2022 If an employee pays group premiums on a pre-tax basis through a cafeteria plan, the IRS will tax any\n\nbenefits as income.\n\n\u2022 The pre-tax contribution avoids taxation when money is paid to the insurer; therefore, the IRS will tax\n\nfunds when benefits are paid, often when they\u2019re needed the most.\n\n\u2022 In some companies, employees pay their disability premiums with after-tax dollars.\n\n\u2022 In such cases, the premiums are not deductible (i.e., they\u2019re after-tax), so the benefits are not taxable.\n\n\u2022 If the employee-paid portion of the premium is paid pre-tax, then the entire benefit is taxable.\n\n\u2022 If employees pay their portion of the premium with after-tax dollars, the benefit will be partially taxable\n\nand partially tax-free. The degree to which the benefit is income tax-free reflects the percentage of the premium that\u2019s taxable.\n\n\u2022 The IRS will only tax the funds once\u2014either on the way in or on the way out.\n\n\u2022 For a business overhead expense policy, the premium is a tax-deductible business expense.\n\n\u2022 The benefit is considered a part of taxable revenue.\n\n\u2022 The benefits offset other deductible business expenses.\n\n[EXAM TIP: When trying to figure out what a BOE policy does NOT cover, the answer is\n\n\u201cemployer income\u201d or \u201cthe insured\u2019s lost income\u201d or some other similar answer.]\n\n\u2022 The company buys disability insurance on each partner or each shareholder in a closed corporation.\n\n\u2022 If the partner or the shareholder is disabled, the company receives the benefit.\n\n\u2022 The taxation works like a standard individual policy. Since the policy holder (the company) pays a\n\npremium with after-tax dollars, the policy benefit is income tax-free.",

It ends on the last day of October later that year.\n\n\u2022 If an individual fails to enroll in Part B during the initial enrollment period, she may use the annual\n\nopen enrollment period, which is January 1 through March 31.\n\n\u2022 However, coverage doesn\u2019t begin until the following July 1.\n\n\u2022 Late enrollees may pay a higher premium.\n\nPremiums\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no Medicare Part A premium for any individual who\u2019s covered by Social Security and is\n\n\u201cfully insured.\u201d Other Medicare-eligible persons must pay a monthly premium.\n\n\u2022 Every person who elects Medicare Part B pays a monthly premium that\u2019s automatically deducted from\n\nhis Social Security check.\n\n\u2022 In 2021, the standard monthly premium is $148.50.\n\n\u2022 Individuals and joint filers with incomes of $88,000 and $176,000, respectively, will pay more.\n\nPARTICIPATING PROVIDERS AND MEDICARE ASSIGNMENT\n\n\u2022 Participating providers accept assignment and agree to accept the approved Medicare fee for their services.\n\n\u2022 Non-participating providers don\u2019t accept assignment.

For example, let\u2019s assume that an LTCI contract with a three-year benefit period pays a maximum of $100 per day for institutional care and $50 per day for home care.\n\n\u25e6 The maximum daily benefit (for institutional care) is $100 per day.\n\n\u25e6 1,095 days x $100 per day = a $109,500 pool of money.\n\n\u25e6 This calculation means that the policy will pay the maximum daily benefit for three years.\n\nIF THE\n\n\u2022 insured only uses the policy to pay for home care, the policy will pay only $50 per day for six years ($109,500 = $50 x 2,190 days).\n\nDAILY BENEFIT AMOUNTS\n\n\u2022 LTCI includes a daily limit to benefits.\n\n\u2022 A higher daily limit means a higher annual premium.\n\n\u2022 Policies often set home care limits between 50% and 80% of the maximum benefit for nursing home care.\n\n\u2022 LTCI contracts pay daily benefits in one of two ways\u2014as a fixed daily indemnity or based on the actual costs incurred (reimbursement). For example, let\u2019s assume that an insured has a long-term care insurance policy with a stated daily benefit of $200 per day. The insured incurs covered costs of $150 during a single 24-hour period.\n\n\u25e6 If the insured has a policy that pays a daily indemnity, the insured will receive $200.\n\n\u25e6 If the insured has a policy that reimburses actual costs up to $200, the insured will receive $150.\n\nELIMINATION PERIOD\n\n\u2022 LTCI policies generally include an elimination period.\n\n\u2022 This period helps to restrain the cost of coverage for prospective policyholders.\n\nWAIVER OF PREMIUM\n\n\u2022 The waiver of premium provision suspends premium payments while the insured is receiving benefits.\n\n\u2022 Some LTC policies offer a lower premium by not including this feature and offering it as an optional rider instead.\n\nLONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE \u2013 OPTIONAL PROVISIONS\n\nRETURN OF PREMIUM OPTION\n\n\u2022 The return of premium rider refunds the premiums paid by the policy owner under certain circumstances, such as when a policy lapses or the insured dies without using the policy\u2019s benefits.",

They\u2019re deductible in combination with other medical expenses to the extent that they exceed 7.5% of an individual\u2019s adjusted gross income.\n\n\u2022 In addition, HIPAA exempts qualified policy benefits in excess of actual expenses from income tax up to a daily limit.\n\nQUALIFIED LONG-TERM CARE POLICIES\n\n\u2022 To be designated as tax-qualified, a long-term care insurance policy must meet the following criteria:\n\n\u25e6 The policy cannot pay expenses that are reimbursable under Medicare.\n\n\u25e6 The benefit trigger must be either the loss of a person\u2019s ability to perform two of the six\n\nADLS OR\n\n\u2022 the existence of a severe cognitive impairment.\n\n\u25e6 The policy is at least guaranteed renewable.\n\n\u25e6 The policy doesn\u2019t include a cash surrender value.\n\n\u25e6 The policy only provides long-term care services.\n\n\u25e6 The policy has a 30-day fee-look period.\n\n\u25e6 The policy requires all claims to be based on a medical diagnosis of disability lasting at least 90\n\n\u2022 days.\n\n\u25e6 When an insured files a claim, the policy requires that a medical professional devise a written\n\n\u2022 plan of care.\n\nMEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND LTCI\n\n\u2022 Medicare, Medicaid, and long-term care insurance address senior citizens\u2019 needs, but the role of each policy is distinct and not interchangeable. The following section offers a quick comparison of these three mechanisms.\n\nMedicare\n\n\u2022 Medicare is medical insurance in the traditional sense for individuals who are the age of 65 and older, along with certain individuals who suffer from a severe disability. It provides treatment to acute and chronic illnesses to cure acute conditions or treat chronic diseases so as to mitigate them.\n\nMedicaid\n\n\u2022 Medicaid is a means-tested, public program that was established to provide medical and supportive services to individuals who are at or below the poverty line. The funding comes from both the federal government and state budgets. Each state administers its own program.\n\n\u2022 Medicaid services overlap with both Medicare and long-term insurance. Low-income individuals who are the age of 65 and older can qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid to cover their medical costs more fully. Senior citizens who lack assets can be eligible for long-term services and supports (LTSS) paid by Medicaid.\n\n\u2022 Originally, Medicaid paid for LTSS delivered in nursing homes. However, given the increasing costs of such care, the federal government granted states the authority to devise alternative programs that deliver such services using alternative avenues, such as in-home care. Individuals can qualify for Medicaid funding for LTSS only when their countable assets (other than their residence and some other such property) are depleted. At times, more affluent individuals may attempt to qualify for Medicaid while sheltering assets from liquidation by transferring property to relatives. The states consider all asset transfers over the five years before any application for Medicaid benefits. If an insured transfers assets to family members, the medical assistance administrators will delay the insured\u2019s access to public funding for long-term services and support.",

      "content": "PROVISIONS\n\nNAIC MODEL UNIFORM HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY PROVISIONS\n\n\u2022 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) developed a Uniform Individual Accident and Sickness Policy Provisions Law Model. In accordance with the NAIC Model, there are 23 uniform provisions for use in insurance contracts\u201412 uniform mandatory provisions and 11 uniform optional provisions.\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies may substitute their own language with approval from their various state regulators.\n\n\u2022 Substitute language can be no less favorable to the insured. This uniform language requirement helps assure a consistent understanding of policy terms and provisions.\n\nTHE 12 REQUIRED (MANDATORY) UNIFORM\n\nPROVISIONS\n\nTHE ENTIRE CONTRACT CLAUSE\n\n\u2022 In a health insurance policy, the entire contract clause defines the entire contract as the policy, the\n\ninsured\u2019s application, and any papers that are attached to the policy document.\n\n\u2022 Nothing outside of the contract (as described above) can be considered part of the contract.\n\n\u2022 It assures the policy owner that no changes will be made without the policy holder\u2019s written consent.\n\n[EXAM TIP: Remember WYSIWYG. \u201cWhat you see is what you get!\u201d]\n\nTime Limit on Certain Defenses (Incontestability)\n\n\u2022 The time limit on certain defenses provision declares the policy to be incontestable after it has been\n\nin force for three years.\n\n\u2022 Fraud on a health insurance application is always grounds for termination unless the policy is\n\nguaranteed renewable or non-cancellable.\n\n\u2022 A number of states reduced the time limit on certain defenses to two years.\n\n[EXAM TIP: Assume a time limit of three years unless the test references state law or integrates law and general questions. In other cases, check the law, and assume three years if no specific reference is given.]\n\nGRACE PERIOD\n\n\u2022 Insurers must include a grace period following the premium due date, during which time the insured\n\nmay make the delayed premium payment without penalty or loss of coverage. The specified minimum grace periods are:\n\n\u25e6 Seven days for policies with weekly premium payments (i.e., industrial policies)\n\n\u25e6 10 days for policies with premiums payable monthly, and\n\n\u25e6 31 days for other policies\n\nReinstatement\n\n\u2022 The reinstatement provision restricts reinstatement payments to premiums that are due within the\n\nprevious 60 days.\n\n\u2022 Reinstatement is automatic if the insurer accepts the delinquent premium and doesn\u2019t require an\n\napplication.\n\n\u2022 If the insurer requires an application, the insurer must respond to the application within 45 days, or the\n\npolicy is automatically reinstated.\n\n\u2022 Reinstated policies cover accidents immediately and impose a 10-day probationary period on losses\n\ndue to sickness.\n\nNOTICE OF CLAIM\n\n\u2022 The notice of claim provision describes the policy owner\u2019s obligation to notify the insurer of loss within a reasonable period\u201420 days after the occurrence or as soon as reasonably possible after that.\n\n\u2022 For long-term disability claims, an insurer may request notice of claim every six months to ensure a continuing disability.\n\n[EXAM TIP: Assume 20 days unless the exam specifies a disability claim.]\n\nCLAIM FORMS\n\n\u2022 The company must supply a claim form within 15 days after receiving notice of claim or accept information in any format that the insured provides.\n\nPROOF OF LOSS\n\n\u2022 An insured claimant must provide proof of loss with 90 days of the occurrence.\n\n\u2022 If the insured is legally incapable of doing so, she can provide proof within one year.\n\nTIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS\n\n\u2022 The time of payment of claims provision provides for:\n\n\u25e6 Immediate claim payment after notification and proof of loss\n\n\u25e6 At least monthly payments for disability income claims\n\n[EXAM TIP: If an exam references the required frequency of disability payments, it may describe\n\nthe minimum requirements as \u201cno less frequently than monthly.\u201d An accurate reading is\n\nESSENTIAL.] PAYMENT OF CLAIMS\n\n\u2022 The payment of claims provision states that health insurance benefits must be payable to the insured.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM AND AUTOPSY\n\n\u2022 The physical exam and autopsy provision gives the insurer the right to require a physical examination or autopsy of an insured, at its own expense, before paying a claim.\n\n\u2022 This physical exam or autopsy is allowed unless it\u2019s forbidden by state law.",

      "content": "INSURING CLAUSE\n\n\u2022 The insuring clause is the part of the health insurance policy that primarily states:\n\n\u25e6 The benefits provided and\n\n\u25e6 The circumstances under which they\u2019re payable\n\n\u2022 The clause defines the insurance company\u2019s promise to pay benefits.\n\nCONSIDERATION CLAUSE\n\n\u2022 The consideration clause defines the insured\u2019s consideration.\n\n\u2022 The policy owner\u2019s consideration consists of the following two elements:\n\n\u25e6 The premium paid, and\n\n\u25e6 The statements (legal representations) that are made on the health insurance application\n\nWAIVER OF PREMIUM\n\n\u2022 The waiver of premium provision waives the payment of premiums after the insured has been totally disabled for the specified period (as stipulated in the policy).\n\nMILITARY SUSPENSE PROVISION\n\n\u2022 This provision temporarily suspends coverage for an insured who\u2019s called up to activity duty, but coverage resumes when the period of service ends.\n\nRENEWABILITY PROVISIONS\n\n\u2022 Health insurance policies have one of the various renewability clauses that define the circumstances\n\nunder which an insurer may change or terminate an existing contract.\n\n\u2022 The insured can cancel the policy at any time.\n\nNON-CANCELLABLE POLICIES\n\n\u2022 A non-cancellable policy is one that cannot be canceled as long as the policy owner pays the premium.\n\n\u2022 Some contracts refer to this type of policy as \u201cnon-cancellable and guaranteed renewable.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The insurer can neither modify the policy\u2019s terms nor increase the premium.\n\n\u2022 This type of renewal provision is the most advantageous renewal provision for a policy holder but is also the most expensive.\n\nGUARANTEED RENEWABLE POLICIES\n\n\u2022 Insurers cannot terminate a guaranteed renewable policy as long as the premium is paid.\n\n\u2022 The insurer cannot change policy benefits, conditions, or terms in any way.\n\n\u2022 The insurer is allowed to increase premiums on a class basis (not on a specific policy) in response to a general change in the class\u2019s aggregate risk level. For example, a disability income insurer can raise premiums on all policies that are issued to nurses and other gray collar professionals in response to an increase in back injuries and the rise of new infectious diseases. It cannot increase the premiums paid by a specific nurse because of chronic back problems.\n\nCONDITIONALLY RENEWABLE POLICIES\n\n\u2022 An insurer may decide not to renew a conditionally renewable policy under certain conditions that are stated in the policy.\n\n\u2022 These conditions are typically related to the insured reaching a certain age or losing gainful employment.\n\n\u2022 The stated reasons that allow an insurer to terminate coverage are based on general conditions, not individual insurability.\n\n\u2022 Carriers can also increase policy premiums at renewal on a class basis only.\n\nOPTIONALLY RENEWABLE POLICIES (RENEWABLE\n\nAT COMPANY\u2019S OPTION)\n\n\u2022 The optionally renewal policy offers no guarantee of continuance beyond the end of the current policy renewal period.\n\n\u2022 The insurer also has the option to increase the premiums for any policy class (not an individual policy).\n\nNON-RENEWABLE POLICIES\n\n\u2022 Non-renewable policies are typically used to meet short-term health insurance needs.\n\n\u2022 These policies remain in force for one year or less.\n\n\u2022 Policy holders use them to bridge anticipated coverage gaps.\n\nPERIOD OF TIME\n\n\u2022 These policies, such as \u201cshort-term major medical\u201d plans\u2014also referred to as term policies\u2014are only\n\nrenewable for a stipulated term (e.g., six months) or period.",

      "content": "CANCELLABLE POLICIES\n\n\u2022 Either the insured or insurer may cancel coverage.\n\n\u2022 The renewability provision allows the insurer to cancel this type of policy with a five-day written notice and the return of any unearned premiums.\n\n\u2022 An insurer may cancel an individual policy if the insured files too many claims in a policy period.\n\n\u2022 Most states don\u2019t allow the issuance of cancellable health insurance policies.\n\nPOLICY EXCLUSIONS, LIMITS, AND RESTRICTIONS\n\n\u2022 Health insurance policies frequently cite a number of exclusions or conditions that are not covered, such as:\n\n\u25e6 Injuries due to war or an act of war\n\n\u25e6 Injuries sustained while serving in the armed services\n\n\u25e6 Self-inflicted injuries, including suicide\n\n\u25e6 Injuries while the insured is piloting an aircraft or serving as a crew member\n\n\u25e6 Non-commercial air travel\n\n\u25e6 Foreign travel, especially extended stays overseas or foreign residence\n\n\u25e6 Losses resulting from riots, or the use of drugs or narcotics\n\n\u25e6 Injuries sustained while attempting or committing a felony\n\n\u25e6 Losses covered by Workers\u2019 Compensation\n\n\u25e6 Care paid by the Veterans Administration (VA)\n\n\u25e6 Cosmetic surgery, experimental surgery, and vision correction\n\nPROBATIONARY PERIOD\n\n\u2022 The probationary period is a one-time 30-day event that becomes effective when the policy is issued.\n\n\u2022 It excludes losses due to illness during the first days of a new policy, asserting the infection occurred before coverage began, even if symptoms did not appear until after coverage began.\n\n\u2022 Coverage for accidents is not excluded.\n\nPRE-EXISTING CONDITION PROVISIONS\n\n\u2022 The preexisting condition provision states that a health insurance policy will not cover any health condition that existed during the period immediately before the policy became effective. Most often, this provision applies to conditions that are not disclosed in an insurance application.\n\n\u2022 This provision is essential for group insurance or other contracts with simplified underwriting or none at all.\n\n\u2022 This provision helps to protect an insurer regardless of whether an applicant knows he\u2019s ill.\n\n\u2022 This provision doesn\u2019t typically apply to disclosed preexisting conditions. (See \u201cimpairment rider\u201d below.)\n\nIMPAIRMENT (WAIVER FOR IMPAIRMENT) RIDER\n\n\u2022 An impairment rider is also referred to as an exclusion rider, coverage waiver, or a waiver of\n\ndisability.\n\n\u2022 Impairment riders allow an insurer to restrict coverage for an illness or injury that\u2019s disclosed on an\n\napplication for the life of the contract.\n\n\u2022 Since the rider allows the insurer to exclude a significant source of greater than average risk, the\n\ninsurance carrier can often provide coverage at the standard premium.\n\n\u2022 If an impairment rider is attached to a policy, its restrictions or limitations must be explained to the\n\npolicy owner at the time of delivery. Generally, the policy owner must sign a statement that he\u2019s aware of and understands the effects and limitations of this type of rider.\n\nADDITIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY PROVISIONS\n\nOWNER\u2019S RIGHTS PROVISION\n\n\u2022 This provision states that the policy holder is entitled to all of the ownership rights under the health insurance contract.\n\nASSIGNMENT PROVISION\n\n\u2022 Unlike life insurance, policy owners don\u2019t have an unlimited ability to transfer their rights because health insurance is a personal contract.\n\n\u2022 They can assign certain benefits to providers for direct payment of expenses.\n\nBENEFICIARY PROVISION\n\n\u2022 When health insurance includes a death benefit, the Required Uniform Mandatory Provisions include a \u201cchange of beneficiary\u201d provision.\n\n\u2022 This provision may require detailed information that\u2019s most commonly associated with life insurance.\n\nBENEFICIARY TYPES\n\n\u2022 Insurance gives the insured the ability to deliver benefits directly to named individuals, groups, or\n\ninstitutions without going through the probate process.\n\n\u2022 If no beneficiary is named, any death benefit is included in the insured\u2019s estate.\n\n\u25e6 Individual beneficiaries: In this case, the insured names one or more specific individuals to\n\n\u2022 receive a death benefit.\n\n\u25e6 Beneficiary Class: A beneficiary class or class designation defines beneficiaries by describing\n\n\u2022 them rather than naming them.\n\nORDER OF SUCCESSION\n\n\u2022 Primary beneficiaries: These beneficiaries receive all of the benefits at the insured\u2019s death.\n\n\u2022 Secondary (contingent) beneficiaries: These beneficiaries only receive benefits if all of the primary\n\nbeneficiaries have predeceased the insured.

Some policies include this provision automatically, while others offer it as an optional rider. Some policies condition the restoration with a requirement to be claim-free for a specific period following a covered loss.\n\nCOORDINATION OF BENEFITS\n\n\u2022 The coordination of benefits provision is found in group insurance, but it also applies to social insurance programs (e.g., Medicare).\n\n\u2022 The provision limits the total amount of payments from all insurers that cover the claim to no more than the total cost of care (e.g., avoids duplication of benefits).\n\n\u2022 The COB provision also establishes which plan is primary and must pay all of the benefits specified by the contract. Once the primary insurance plan pays benefits as if it were the only available coverage, the secondary provider is liable for the remaining costs.\n\n\u2022 Employer-sponsored group insurance is the primary coverage for workers who are the age of 65 or older if the employer is a \u201cCOBRA group\u201d of 20 or more employees.\n\n\u2022 If a group has fewer than 20 employees, Medicare is the primary insurer.\n\n\u2022 Medicare is always the primary coverage for any person with an individual policy or group retiree medical insurance.",

      "content": "THE PURPOSE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF UNDERWRITING INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 The underwriting process determines an insurer\u2019s ability to insure a loss exposure by reviewing and evaluating an applicant\u2019s information and applying the carrier\u2019s guidelines for insurability.\n\n\u2022 Once underwriters determine whether a loss exposure is insurable, they determine the required premium rate.\n\nRISK FACTORS IN HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n\u2022 The risk factors for life and health insurance are similar, but health insurers deal with a broader range\n\nof risks.\n\nINSURABLE INTEREST\n\n\u2022 Insurable interest is a prerequisite for issuing a health policy.\n\n\u2022 It exists if the applicant will suffer a loss in the event the insured incurs medical expenses or becomes\n\ndisabled.\n\nPHYSICAL CONDITION AND HEALTH HISTORY\n\n\u2022 An applicant\u2019s physical condition, which refers to his health and body build, is of primary importance\n\nwhen evaluating health risks.\n\n\u2022 Typically, an insurer is just as concerned with an applicant\u2019s health history as it is with his current\n\nhealth. An applicant\u2019s medical history can help predict future healthcare needs, as can his family\u2019s health history.\n\nMORAL HAZARDS\n\n\u2022 Applicants\u2019 habits or lifestyles also indicate the potential of additional risks for the insurer. These\n\nfactors are referred to as moral hazards. Examples include excessive drinking or drug use. Other signs of moral hazard can be a low credit rating or dishonest business practices.\n\nOCCUPATION AND HOBBIES\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s a direct correlation between a person\u2019s job and the probability and severity of a disabling\n\ninjury occurring.\n\n\u2022 If an applicant has two jobs, the insurance company will base the benefits and the premiums on the\n\nmore hazardous one.\n\n\u2022 An applicant\u2019s hobbies and personal activities can also affect whether a carrier covers a proposed\n\ninsured. Activities such as mountain climbing or having a license to pilot small planes can affect insurability or, at best, increase the cost of coverage.\n\n\u2022 Hobbies are also referred to as avocations.\n\nAGE AND SEX\n\n\u2022 An insured\u2019s age and sex (gender) are underwriting factors.\n\n\u25e6 Generally, older applicants are more significant risks.\n\n\u25e6 Women have higher rates of disability at younger ages, but insurers CANNOT reject prospective\n\n\u2022 insureds based on gender.\n\nClassification of Risk Exposures (Applicants)\n\n\u2022 Once underwriters review an applicant\u2019s information, they will determine that applicant\u2019s level of risk\n\nor risk classification.\n\n\u2022 There are three classifications of those that are insurable. Individuals who are not insurable are\n\nclassified as declined.\n\nPREFERRED RISK\n\n\u2022 A preferred risk exceeds an insurer\u2019s risk requirements.\n\n\u2022 Companies issue preferred risk policies with reduced premiums with the expectation of better (lower)\n\nthan average morbidity experience.\n\nSTANDARD RISK\n\n\u2022 Individuals who are assigned a standard risk classification meet the same conditions as the tabular\n\nrisks on which the insurer\u2019s premium rates are based.\n\n\u2022 A standard risk is an average risk.\n\nSUBSTANDARD (RATED) RISK\n\n\u2022 A substandard risk is an individual who fails to meet the insurer\u2019s standard or average risk guidelines.\n\n\u2022 Insuring the substandard application involves taking on a greater-than-average risk of loss.\n\n\u2022 The terms \u201crated policy\u201d and \u201crated premium\u201d refer to a substandard policy with a higher-than-\n\naverage (rated-up) premium.\n\nPREMIUM CALCULATIONS GENERAL INSURANCE PREMIUM CONCEPTS\n\nPremium\n\n\u2022 Premium is the initial payment and subsequent periodic payments required to keep a policy in force.\n\nPREMIUM MODE\n\n\u2022 The mode refers to the frequency of premium payments.\n\n\u2022 Premiums can be paid quarterly, semiannually, or monthly.\n\n\u2022 The higher the frequency of payments, the more the policy will cost the insured in total.\n\nEARNED PREMIUM\n\n\u2022 Earned premium is a pro-rated amount of a paid premium that an insurer has \u201cearned\u201d by providing\n\ncoverage.\n\nUNEARNED PREMIUM\n\n\u2022 Unearned premium represents the portion of paid premiums that has yet to be \u201cearned\u201d because it\u2019s\n\nallocated to cover the remaining portion of the policy term.\n\nPOLICY TERM\n\n\u2022 This is the period during which a policy remains in existence when a premium is paid.\n\nPOLICY FEE\n\n\u2022 The policy fee is a small transaction fee that\u2019s charged by some insurers for the first or subsequent\n\nyears of an insurance policy, in addition to the regular premium.\n\n\u2022 Primary Health Insurance Premium Factors",

This is the initial step in the underwriting process, in which\n\nthey gather necessary underwriting information and distribute required disclosures to the buyer.\n\n\u2022 A field underwriter (producer) solicits appointments, completes, and submits applications, and\n\ncollects premiums.\n\n\u2022 The producer does NOT issue the policy.\n\nAGENT RESPONSIBILITY\n\n\u2022 Agents have a fiduciary responsibility to consumers during insurance transactions.\n\n\u2022 Agents act in a fiduciary capacity for the insurers when collecting premiums.\n\n\u2022 Agents complete the following essential tasks:\n\n\u25e6 Engaging in proper solicitation\n\n\u25e6 Completing the application properly\n\n\u25e6 Obtaining appropriate signatures\n\n\u25e6 Collecting the initial premium, and\n\n\u25e6 Issuing the correct premium receipt\n\nPROPER SOLICITATION\n\n\u2022 Agents have a duty to solicit profitable applications.\n\n\u2022 Agents are responsible for following the highest professional standard when working with consumers.\n\n\u2022 Agents must obtain authorization forms to gather third-party investigative reports.\n\n\u2022 Where required, agents must obtain signed forms to verify that applicants received necessary\n\ndisclosures.\n\nUNFAIR DISCRIMINATION\n\n\u2022 No insurer may engage in unfair discrimination based on any protected category such as sexual\n\norientation, religious preference, or geographical location.\n\nTHE APPLICANT\n\n\u2022 The applicant is the person who\u2019s requesting the insurance.\n\n\u2022 Typically, the applicant is also the proposed insured.\n\nTHE PROPOSED INSURED\n\n\u2022 The proposed insured is the person who\u2019s obtaining the insurance.\n\n\u2022 The policy holder retains all of the rights and options that are conferred by the policy. The policy\n\nholder is also typically the payor.\n\nTHE UNDERWRITER\n\n\u2022 An underwriter reviews insurance applications, classifies the degree of risk, and determines\n\ninsurability and premium rate.",

If not, it will not be underwritten.\n\n\u2022 Each application also requires the signatures of the proposed adult insured and the policy owner (if different from the insured).\n\n\u2022 Where required by state law, the agent also must sign a form attesting that a disclosure statement has been given to the applicant.\n\n\u2022 Additionally, a form that authorizes the insurance company to obtain investigative consumer reports or medical information from investigative agencies, physicians, hospitals, or other sources generally must be signed by the proposed insured with the agent as a witness.",

      "content": "MINOR APPLICANTS AND PROPOSED INSUREDS\n\n\u2022 In most states, any person who\u2019s under the age of 18 is considered a minor. This age is also referred to as the age of majority.\n\n\u2022 Companies require the signature of a parent or guardian if the proposed insured is under the age of 18.\n\nCHANGES TO THE APPLICATION\n\n\u2022 If applicants make mistakes when completing applications, they can have their agent correct the information, but they must initial the correction.\n\n\u2022 When attached to the insurance policy, the application becomes a part of a legal contract.\n\nADDITIONAL LAWS, DISCLOSURES, AND SOURCES OF\n\nUNDERWRITING INFORMATION\n\n\u2022 Insurers must obtain the applicant\u2019s permission to legally receive necessary additional information from third-party sources.\n\nTHE MEDICAL REPORT\n\n\u2022 For policies that provide substantial benefits, a medical report may be needed to provide further underwriting information.\n\n\u2022 Medical reports may come from the insured\u2019s physician, or an examination done during the application process.\n\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN\u2019S STATEMENT\n\n\u2022 Underwriters may request an attending physician\u2019s statement (APS) from the applicant\u2019s physician if the application\u2019s medical section raises questions about a particular medical condition.\n\n\u2022 The statement will provide details about the medical condition in question.\n\n\u2022 The completed report is forwarded to the insurer, where its medical staff reviews the information.\n\nThe Medical Information Bureau (MIB Group)\n\n\u2022 The Medical Information Bureau (MIB) is another source of information about an applicant\u2019s medical history.\n\n\u2022 The MIB is a clearinghouse of health information that\u2019s supplied by insurers from previous applications.\n\n\u2022 The MIB helps to detect any undisclosed adverse health conditions.\n\n\u2022 The MIB report will identify insurance in force with other carriers and will disclose lifestyle habits (e.g., drug use).\n\n\u2022 The MIB\u2019s purpose is to help expose fraud cases and unintentional acts of misrepresentation or concealment.\n\n\u2022 An MIB report by itself cannot be the basis for declining an application; instead, it\u2019s the basis for initiating an investigation.\n\n\u2022 The MIB may release information to the proposed insured\u2019s physician.\n\nPRIVACY NOTICE\n\n\u2022 According to the HIPAA statute\u2019s privacy rule, when an agent submits an application that contains personally identifiable health information, the agent is responsible for providing the applicant with privacy notices.\n\n\u2022 Producers must also secure HIV consent forms to conduct applicant blood tests, despite the fact that they may be part of the standard underwriting process.\n\nUSA PATRIOT ACT\n\n\u2022 The USA PATRIOT Act requires insurance companies to establish formal anti-money laundering\n\nprograms.\n\nSPECIAL QUESTIONNAIRES\n\n\u2022 Special questionnaires gather more detailed information about a non-medical aspect of the applicant\u2019s life, such as avocations (e.g., mountain climbing).\n\nINSPECTION REPORTS\n\n\u2022 Inspection reports provide a picture of an applicant\u2019s general character and reputation, mode of living, finances, and any exposure to abnormal hazards.\n\n\u2022 Investigators or inspectors may interview employees, neighbors, and associates of the applicant, as well as the applicant himself.\n\n\u2022 It may also include a credit report.\n\nCREDIT REPORTS\n\n\u2022 Since some applicants may be poor credit risks, credit reports from the credit bureaus are a valuable underwriting tool.\n\n\u2022 Applicants with questionable credit ratings can cause an insurance company to lose money by allowing their policies to lapse shortly after they\u2019re issued.",

      "content": "The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) of 1970\n\n\u2022 The FCRA protects the rights of consumers for whom a credit report is requested.\n\n\u2022 The FCRA established procedures for collecting and disseminating consumer credit information.\n\n\u2022 Let\u2019s assume that an insurer declines a consumer due to poor credit. In this case, the FCRA requires the insurer to notify the applicant that a copy of the credit report is available through the appropriate credit bureau.\n\nINFORMATION AND PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT\n\n\u2022 According to the Information and Privacy Protection Act, insurers must conform to state and federal laws regarding the dissemination of a consumer\u2019s private information.\n\nTHE INITIAL PREMIUM AND\n\nPREMIUM RECEIPTS\n\n\u2022 The nature of a receipt is that it denotes the payment of funds for goods or services. In this case, it denotes the good faith payment of an initial premium in return for the company\u2019s promise to pay. Premium receipts are important because they can establish a person\u2019s protection under the terms of a policy before the insurer issues the contract.\n\nPREMIUMS PAID WITH THE APPLICATION\n\n\u2022 The proposed insured benefits from paying the initial premium with the application. Insurance protection becomes effective immediately; however, it comes with significant limitations.\n\n\u2022 If the first premium is not paid with the application, the policy will not become effective until the initial premium is collected.\n\n\u2022 An application without a premium is referred to as a trial application.\n\n\u2022 When an agent collects a premium with an application, the agent must give the applicant a premium receipt.\n\n\u2022 The type of receipt determines when coverage is effective.\n\nPREMIUM RECEIPTS\n\n\u2022 Applicants who pay a premium with the application are entitled to a premium receipt.\n\n\u2022 Two types of receipts exist\u2014conditional receipts and binding receipts.\n\n\u2022 The date on a receipt is always earlier than the policy\u2019s issue date.\n\n\u2022 Today, the most common type of premium receipt is a conditional receipt.\n\nCONDITIONAL RECEIPTS\n\n\u2022 Conditional receipts generally provide coverage as of the date of the receipt as long as a specific condition is satisfied.\n\n\u2022 Coverage is provided if the proposed insured demonstrates insurability.\n\n\u2022 Insurability may be accomplished simply by submitting the application and supporting documentation, or it may require a medical exam.\n\n\u2022 Coverage is effective on the condition that the applicant proves to be insurable, either on the date on which the application was signed or the date of the medical exam.\n\n\u2022 If the applicant proves to be uninsurable, no coverage takes effect, and the premium is refunded.\n\nINSURABILITY TYPE CONDITIONAL RECEIPT\n\n\u2022 Coverage is effective if the proposed insured is found to be insurable as applied for (i.e., standard or better).\n\n\u2022 Coverage is effective as of the application date or the date of any required medical exam, whichever is later.\n\n\u2022 Policy delivery is not necessary for coverage to be in effect. [EXAM TIP: If the test refers to a conditional receipt with no further qualification, assume it\u2019s an \u201cinsurability type conditional receipt.\u201d]\n\nAPPROVAL TYPE CONDITIONAL RECEIPT\n\n\u2022 Approval type conditional receipts provide coverage only after the insurer has approved the application.\n\n\u2022 Approval type conditional receipts only provide coverage between the issue date and the delivery date.",

      "content": "BINDING RECEIPTS\n\n\u2022 Binding receipts are often referred to as temporary insurance agreements.\n\n\u2022 Binding receipt guarantees coverage unless the insurer formally rejects the application.\n\n\u2022 Even if uninsurable, the applicant is covered until the application is rejected.\n\n\u2022 A binding receipt typically stipulates the maximum amount that\u2019s payable under the terms of the receipt.\n\n\u2022 Binding receipts are far more common for auto or homeowner\u2019s insurance than life or health insurance.\n\nTEMPORARY INSURANCE AGREEMENT\n\n\u2022 A \u201ctemporary insurance agreement\u201d is similar to a binding receipt.\n\n\u2022 In some jurisdictions, they\u2019re used interchangeably.\n\n\u2022 In contrast to a binding receipt, this agreement can offer a level of additional protection.\n\nOFFER AND COUNTER-OFFER\n\n\u2022 If an applicant completes an application and pays the first full premium, the applicant has made a legal offer.\n\n\u2022 If the insurer issues a policy as requested, it has accepted the applicant\u2019s offer and a contract is in force.\n\nIf the insurer declines the application, it has rejected the offer.\n\n\u2022 If the insurance company is willing to issue a \u201crated\u201d policy at a higher than requested premium, the carrier has rejected the applicant\u2019s initial offer but is making a counter-offer.\n\n\u2022 The applicant can accept the counter-offer by paying the additional premium and providing a statement of continued good health.\n\nPOLICY ISSUE AND DELIVERY\n\n\u2022 Once issued, the policy is sent to the agent for delivery to the applicant.\n\n\u2022 In most states, an agent is required to deliver an outline of coverage to the applicant.\n\n\u2022 In some cases (e.g., when selling long-term care insurance), agents must also deliver a Shopper\u2019s Guide or Buyer\u2019s Guide (generally before the agent accepts the applicant\u2019s initial premium).\n\n\u2022 The outline of coverage describes (in simplified language) the key elements of the specific policy being delivered.\n\nPOLICY EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n\u2022 Determining a policy\u2019s effective date is important because it identifies when the coverage begins and\n\nestablishes the due date for future annual premiums.\n\n\u2022 If a premium receipt were issued, the receipt\u2019s date would generally become the policy\u2019s effective date.\n\n\u2022 If the applicant doesn\u2019t pay an initial premium with the application, the insurance company will\n\ndetermine the policy\u2019s effective date, which will generally be the issue date. (Coverage will not truly be in force until it\u2019s delivered, the first premium is paid, and a Statement of Good Health is obtained.)\n\nCONSTRUCTIVE DELIVERY\n\n\u2022 Constructive delivery means that an insurance carrier can legally deliver a policy without physically\n\ndelivering the contract into the policy owner\u2019s possession.\n\n\u2022 Constructive delivery occurs if the insurer intentionally relinquishes all control over the policy and\n\nturns it over to a person who\u2019s acting for the policy owner, including the company\u2019s own agent.\n\n\u2022 Mailing the policy to the agent for unconditional delivery to the policy owner also constitutes\n\nconstructive delivery.\n\n\u2022 If the company requires a delivery receipt or statement of continued good health, there\u2019s no\n\nconstructive delivery.\n\n\u2022 Possession of a policy by the client doesn\u2019t establish delivery if all conditions have not been met.\n\nINSPECTION RECEIPT\n\n\u2022 Some proposed insureds may want to review a policy before purchasing it.\n\n\u2022 In this situation, the policy owner will sign an inspection receipt rather than a statement of continued\n\ngood health and will not pay a premium.\n\n\u2022 The prospective insured will examine the policy and then pay the first full premium.\n\n\u2022 The free-look period makes this receipt obsolete.\n\nEXPLAINING THE POLICY AND RATINGS TO CLIENTS\n\n\u2022 Most applicants will not remember all of the essential elements of their policies; therefore, agents\n\nshould deliver them in person.\n\n\u2022 By personally explaining the policy, the agent can avert misunderstandings, policy returns, and\n\npotential lapses.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u25e6 When the policy is a \u201crated\u201d or substandard contract, the agent can discuss the reasons for it being so,\n\nincluding the insured\u2019s increased need for protection.",
